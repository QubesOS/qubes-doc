Before you engage in an activity that will take you a significant amount of time, like implementing a new feature, it’s always good to contact us first, preferably via the :ref:`qubes-devel <introduction/support:qubes-devel>` mailing list. Once we’ve worked out the details, we’ll be grateful to :ref:`receive your patch <developer/code/source-code:how to send patches>`.
