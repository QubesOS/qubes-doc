Contributing code
-----------------


If you’re interested in contributing code, the best starting point is to have a look at our `GitHub issues <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues>`__ to see which tasks are the most urgent. You can filter issues depending on your interest and experience. For example, here are some common issue labels:

- `Help wanted <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22&utf8=%E2%9C%93>`__

- `UX and usability <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3AUX>`__

- `Windows tools <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22C%3A%20windows-tools%22>`__

- `Documentation <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22C%3A%20doc%22>`__

- `Privacy <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22privacy%22%20>`__

- `Debian/Ubuntu <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22C%3A%20Debian%2FUbuntu%22>`__



Before you engage in an activity that will take you a significant amount of time, like implementing a new feature, it’s always good to contact us first, preferably via the :ref:`qubes-devel <introduction/support:qubes-devel>` mailing list. Once we’ve worked out the details, we’ll be grateful to :ref:`receive your patch <developer/code/source-code:how to send patches>`.



Using AI in contributions
-------------------------


All contributions to the Qubes OS Project are carefully reviewed by humans to evaluate whether they meet the project's standards. AI allows potential contributors to generate large amounts of content quickly and at near-zero cost. If these contributions are of high quality, they will be welcome. Unfortunately, however, they're often of low quality, in which case it's easy for even a single AI-assisted contributor to overwhelm the entire project's human review capacity. Out of consideration for the time and care our human reviewers spend on evaluating contributions, and to ensure that the project's limited resources are allocated wisely for the benefit of our users, we request that all contributors disclose the use of AI in their contributions. Contributions in which the use of AI is not disclosed are likely to be deprioritized in review and may be denied without further review at any point in the process, at the discretion of the reviewer. Contributors who intentionally and repeatedly fail to disclose their use of AI in a way that is disruptive for the project or its reviewers may be banned from further contributions or, in severe cases, from participating in the project altogether. Regardless of how content was created, the contributor who submits it will be considered the fully-accountable author of that content.

The foregoing policy applies to all relevant ways of contributing to or interacting with the project, including (but not limited to): code, patches, packages, issue tracking, reporting security issues, documentation, artwork, discussion forums, mailing lists, social media, chat, and email.
