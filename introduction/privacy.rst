Privacy policy
==============


The short version is that we try to respect your privacy as much as
possible. We absolutely do not sell any user data. In fact, we go out of
our way to help you keep your data private from everyone, including us.
For example, from the moment you :doc:`install Qubes OS </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/installation-guide>`, we offer to set up
`Whonix <https://www.whonix.org/>`__ so that all of your updates are
routed through `Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>`__.

Website
-------


For the legally-required boilerplate, see `Website Privacy Policy <https://www.qubes-os.org/website-privacy-policy/>`__.

This is just a static website generated with Jekyll and hosted from
GitHub Pages. We try to use as little JavaScript as possible. We host
all resources locally (no third-party CDNs) so that you only have to
connect to one domain. This site should be easy to browse using Tor
Browser and with scripts blocked. We also have an `onion service <http://qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion/>`__
(access is not logged). We even go out of our way to make it easy to
download `this website’s git repo <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubesos.github.io>`__, including all
the website source code, so that you can host this entire site from your
own local machine offline. Better yet, we’ve specifically written all of
the :doc:`documentation </index>` in Markdown so that the plain text can be
enjoyed from the comfort of your terminal. Here’s the
`repo <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc>`__. (By the way, Git tags
on our repos are PGP-signed so you can
:doc:`verify </project-security/verifying-signatures>` the authenticity of the content.)
Obviously, we don’t use any ads or trackers, but this is still a public
website, so man-in-the-middle attacks and such are always a possibility.
Please be careful. See :ref:`FAQ: Should I trust this website? <introduction/faq:should i trust this website?>`

Update Servers and Repositories
-------------------------------


We provide repositories at https://yum.qubes-os.org and
https://deb.qubes-os.org.

We collect and store standard server access and error logs, which
include IP addresses. We use this data for generating :doc:`Qubes userbase statistics </introduction/statistics>` and for incident response.

The data is retained for up to three months so that we can re-calculate
the previous two months’ statistics in case anything goes wrong. After
that, the data is deleted. We never sell the data to anyone or share it
with any third party.

If you would like to hide your IP address from us, we strongly encourage
it and are happy to help you do so! Simply choose the Whonix option to
route all of your updates over Tor when :doc:`installing Qubes OS </user/downloading-installing-upgrading/installation-guide>`.

Onion Services
--------------


We provide an `onion service <http://www.qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion>`__
for the website and onion service mirrors of the repositories. Access to
these servers is not logged.

Mirrors
-------


There are also other third-party mirrors hosted by volunteers. These are
used both for `ISO downloads <https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads/#mirrors>`__ and
`updates <#update-servers-and-repositories>`__. We have no control over
what data these mirrors collect or with whom they share it. Please see
the privacy policy of each respective mirror operator.

Qubes OS
--------


We have specifically designed Qubes OS so that it is not possible to
collect any data directly from Qubes OS installations. In other words,
Qubes OS does not have the ability to “phone home” and is intentionally
architected to forbid that from happening. This is mainly because we
have ensured that dom0 has no network access.

We don’t want the ability to collect any data directly from Qubes OS
installations, because if anyone has that power, then the system is not
secure. We use Qubes OS ourselves as a daily driver for our work and
personal lives, so our interests are aligned with yours. We want privacy
too! Thankfully, Qubes OS is free and open-source software, so you don’t
have to take our word for it.

Of course, third-party software (including other operating systems)
running inside of Qubes OS may not be as privacy-respecting, so please
be mindful of what you install. We have no control over such third-party
software.
