Qubes OS at a Glance
====================

Qubes OS is based on a set of concepts that are quite different from those of most traditional operating systems. These conventional operating systems are monolithic, meaning everything runs together in a single, large space. Imagine your digital life as a house with no interior walls. Your office, your bedroom, and your safe are all in the same open room. If a burglar gets in through a window, they have immediate access to everything.

This is exactly how most computers work. A single wrong action—opening an email attachment containing malicious software (malware) or visiting a compromised website—can infect your entire system. Once malware is in, the damage can be extensive.

Qubes OS represents not an incremental improvement but a paradigm shift in endpoint security. Its architecture is built on the core principle of "security by compartmentalization." This philosophy moves beyond the flawed pursuit of perfect prevention and instead accepts the inevitability of successful attacks. Its primary goal is to contain and mitigate the impact of a breach, ensuring that the compromise of one component does not compromise the entire system.

Here are some diagrams illustrating the basic ideas behind Qubes OS's architecture, which may help to get a first impression provide an entry point into the introductory chapters of the documentation.
