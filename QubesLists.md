Qubes Mailing Lists
===================

Please send all the questions regarding Qubes to one of the following mailing lists. Please do **not** send questions to individual Qubes developers. By sending a message to list, you not only give other a chance to help you, but you also might help others by making the discussion public.

The `qubes-users` mailing list
------------------------------

This list is for helping users solve various daily problems with Qubes OS. Example of topics or questions suitable for this list:

-   Installation problems
-   Hardware compatibility problems
-   How do I do...?
-   HCL reports

You don't need to subscribe to post to this list. However, subscribing might still be a good idea, because: 1) you make sure your message will not be eaten by the Google Groups spam filter, and 2) you will get other messages direct to the list.

Please consult the basic documentation before posting to the list:

-   [Installation guides and HCL](/wiki/QubesDownloads) \<-- for problems related to Qubes OS installation
-   [Qubes User's FAQ](/wiki/UserFaq)
-   [Qubes User Guides](/wiki/UserDoc) \<-- for question on how to use Qubes OS

Posting, Subscribing, etc:

-   To post a message to the list, just send an email to (you don't need to be subscribed): `qubes-users@googlegroups.com`
-   To subscribe to the list, send an empty mail to (you don't need a gmail account for that!): `qubes-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com`
-   To unsubscribe, send an empty mail to `qubes-users+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com`
-   The Web interface of the list: [​http://groups.google.com/group/qubes-users](http://groups.google.com/group/qubes-users)

The `qubes-devel` mailing list
------------------------------

This list is mainly for people interested in contributing to Qubes OS, or just willing to learn more about its architecture and implementation. Example of topics and questions suitable for this list:

-   Questions about why we made certain architecture or implementation decisions to implement XYZ this way and not the other way?
-   Questions about code layout and where is code for certain functionality
-   "I would like to implement feature XYZ...." -- discussions about proposed new features, patches, etc.
-   Contributed code and patches
-   Some more or less generic security discussions, somehow relating to Qubes OS

You need to be subscribed in order to post to this list.

Posting, Subscribing, etc:

-   To post a message to the list, send an email to (you need to be subscribed first!): `qubes-devel@googlegroups.com`
-   To subscribe to the list, send an empty mail to (you don't need a gmail account for that!): `qubes-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com`
-   To unsubscribe, send an empty mail to `qubes-devel+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com`
-   The Web interface of the list: [​http://groups.google.com/group/qubes-devel](http://groups.google.com/group/qubes-devel)

General hints and guidelines regarding posting to the lists
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Use an informative and precise subject in your message. This will allow others to easily find your thread in the future and use it as a reference. Example of a bad subject: "Help! Qubes problems!". Example of a good subject: "R2B2 Installation problem: Apple keyboard not working in installer".

-   Be precise and concrete. Do not write an essay, only the essential informations that are needed. Qubes developers are Very Busy People (VBP) and we'd really better spend our time on improving Qubes, rather than reading essays!

-   Do not sorry about your English. Really, nobody gives a damn, whether you're sorry, or not, that your English sucks. If we can't understand you, we will ask (or ignore your message if it's a total mess ;) And, if you really are so ashamed of your written English, then... just learn it, instead of sorry everybody.

-   While we're generally open to hear suggestions of new features, please note that we already have a pretty well defined Roadmap, and it's rather unlikely we will change our schedule in order to accommodate your request. Much more preferred way to get new features into Qubes, those requested by users, is to... contribute code to Qubes that implements them, which we will happily accept, provided it meets our standards. It's always good to first discuss such ideas on the qubes-devel list, before starting the work though.
