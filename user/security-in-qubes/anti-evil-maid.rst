====================
Anti evil maid (AEM)
====================


Background
----------


Please read `this blog article <https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/09/07/anti-evil-maid.html>`__.

Requirements
------------


The current package requires a TPM 1.2 interface and a working Intel TXT
engine. If you cleaned your Intel Management Engine with
e.g. `me_cleaner <https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner>`__ while
installing `CoreBoot <https://www.coreboot.org/>`__ then you are out of
luck. For now you have to choose between cleaning your BIOS and
deploying Anti Evil Maid.

Installing
----------


In Dom0 install ``anti-evil-maid``:

.. code:: bash

      sudo qubes-dom0-update anti-evil-maid



For more information, see the
`qubes-antievilmaid <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-antievilmaid>`__
repository, which includes a ``README``.

Security Considerations
-----------------------


`Qubes security guidelines <https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/19075>`__
dictate that USB devices should never be attached directly to dom0,
since this can result in the entire system being compromised. However,
in its default configuration, installing and using AEM requires
attaching a USB drive (i.e., `mass storage device <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_mass_storage_device_class>`__)
directly to dom0. (The other option is to install AEM to an internal
disk. However, this carries significant security implications, as
explained
`here <https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/09/07/anti-evil-maid.html>`__.)
This presents us with a classic security trade-off: each Qubes user must
make a choice between protecting dom0 from a potentially malicious USB
drive, on the one hand, and protecting the system from Evil Maid
attacks, on the other hand. Given the practical feasibility of attacks
like `BadUSB <https://srlabs.de/badusb/>`__ and revelations regarding
pervasive government hardware backdoors, this is no longer a
straightforward decision. New, factory-sealed USB drives cannot simply
be assumed to be “clean” (e.g., to have non-malicious microcontroller
firmware). Therefore, it is up to each individual Qubes user to evaluate
the relative risk of each attack vector against his or her security
model.

For example, a user who frequently travels with a Qubes laptop holding
sensitive data may be at a much higher risk of Evil Maid attacks than a
home user with a stationary Qubes desktop. If the frequent traveler
judges her risk of an Evil Maid attack to be higher than the risk of a
malicious USB device, she might reasonably opt to install and use AEM.
On the other hand, the home user might deem the probability of an Evil
Maid attack occurring in her own home to be so low that there is a
higher probability that any USB drive she purchases is already
compromised, in which case she might reasonably opt never to attach any
USB devices directly to dom0. (In either case, users can–and
should–secure dom0 against further USB-related attacks through the use
of a `USB VM <https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/19075#creating-and-using-a-usbvm>`__.)
