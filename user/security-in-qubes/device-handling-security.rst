Device handling security
========================


Any additional ability a VM gains is additional attack surface. It’s a
good idea to always attach the minimum entity required in a VM.

For example, attaching a full USB-device offers `more attack surface than attaching a single block device <https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/05/31/usb-security-challenges.html>`__,
while attaching a full block device (e.g. ``sda``) again offers more
attack surface than attaching a single partition (e.g. ``sda1``), since
the targetVM doesn’t have to parse the partition-table. (Attaching a
full block device offers the advantage that most file-managers will
mount and display them correctly, whereas they don’t expect single
partitions to be added and therefore don’t handle them correctly.)

PCI Security
------------


Attaching a PCI device to a qube has serious security implications. It
exposes the device driver running in the qube to an external device (and
sourceVM, which contains the device - e.g. ``sys-usb``). In many cases a
malicious device can choose what driver will be loaded (for example by
manipulating device metadata like vendor and product identifiers) - even
if the intended driver is sufficiently secure, the device may try to
attack a different, less secure driver. Furthermore that VM has full
control of the device and may be able to exploit bugs or malicious
implementation of the hardware, as well as plain security problems the
hardware may pose. (For example, if you attach a USB controller, all the
security implications of USB passthrough apply as well.)

By default, Qubes requires any PCI device to be resettable from the
outside (i.e. via the hypervisor), which completely reinitialises the
device. This ensures that any device that was attached to a compromised
VM, even if that VM was able to use bugs in the PCI device to inject
malicious code, can be trusted again. (Or at least as trusted as it was
when Qubes booted.)

Some devices do not implement a reset option. In these cases, Qubes by
default does not allow attaching the device to any VM. If you decide to
override this precaution, beware that the device may only be trusted
when attached to the first VM. Afterwards, it should be **considered tainted** until the whole system is shut down. Even without malicious
intent, usage data may be leaked.

In case device reset is disabled for any reason, detaching the device
should be considered a risk. Ideally, devices for which the
``no-strict-reset`` option is set are attached once to a VM which isn’t
shut down until the system is shut down.

Additionally, Qubes restricts the config-space a VM may use to
communicate with a PCI device. Only whitelisted registers are
accessible. However, some devices or applications require full PCI
access. In these cases, the whole config-space may be allowed. You’re
potentially weakening the device isolation, especially if your system is
not equipped with a VT-d Interrupt Remapping unit. This increases the
VM’s ability to run a `side channel attack <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack>`__ and
vulnerability to the same. See `Xen PCI Passthrough: PV guests and PCI quirks <https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_PCI_Passthrough#PV_guests_and_PCI_quirks>`__
and `Software Attacks on Intel VT-d <https://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/2011/Software%20Attacks%20on%20Intel%20VT-d.pdf>`__
(page 7) for more details.

USB Security
------------


The connection of an untrusted USB device to dom0 is a security risk
since the device can attack an arbitrary USB driver (which are included
in the linux kernel), exploit bugs during partition-table-parsing or
simply pretend to be a keyboard. There are many ready-to-use
implementations of such attacks, e.g. a `USB Rubber Ducky <https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe>`__. The
whole USB stack is put to work to parse the data presented by the USB
device in order to determine if it is a USB mass storage device, to read
its configuration, etc. This happens even if the drive is then assigned
and mounted in another qube.

To avoid this risk, use a :doc:`USB qube </user/advanced-topics/usb-qubes>`.

Attaching a USB device to a VM (USB passthrough) will **expose your target qube** to most of the `security issues <https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/05/31/usb-security-challenges.html>`__
associated with the USB-stack. If possible, use a method specific for
particular device type (for example, block devices described above),
instead of this generic one.

Security Warning On USB Input Devices
-------------------------------------


If you connect USB input devices (keyboard and mouse) to a VM, that VM
will effectively have control over your system. Because of this, the
benefits of using a :doc:`USB qube </user/advanced-topics/usb-qubes>` entrusted with a
keyboard or other interface device are much smaller than using a fully
untrusted USB qube. In addition to having control over your system, such
a VM can also sniff all the input you enter there (for example,
passwords in the case of a USB keyboard).

There is no simple way to protect against sniffing, but you can make it
harder to exploit control over input devices.

If you have only a USB mouse connected to a USB qube, but the keyboard
is connected directly to dom0 (using a PS/2 connector, for example), you
simply need to lock the screen when you are away from your computer
(assuming you don’t use the virtual keyboard of your screen locker). You
must do this every time you leave your computer unattended, even if
there no risk of anyone else having direct physical access to your
computer. This is because you are guarding the system not only against
anyone with local access, but also against possible malicious input from
a potentially compromised USB qube.

If your keyboard is also connected to a USB qube, things are much
harder. Locking the screen (with a traditional password) does not solve
the problem, because the USB qube can simply sniff this password and
later easily unlock the screen. One possibility is to set up the screen
locker to require an additional step to unlock (i.e., two-factor
authentication). One way to achieve this is to use a
:doc:`YubiKey </user/security-in-qubes/mfa>`, or some other hardware token, or even to
manually enter a one-time password.

Support for `two factor authentication <https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2018/09/11/qubes-u2f-proxy/>`__ was recently
added, though there are
`issues <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/4661>`__.
