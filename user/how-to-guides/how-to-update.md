title: How to update
---

*This page is about updating your system while staying on the same [supported
version of Qubes OS](/doc/supported-releases/#qubes-os). If you're instead
looking to upgrade from your current version of Qubes OS to a newer version,
see the [Upgrade Guides](/doc/upgrade/).*

## Security updates

Security updates are an extremely important part of keeping your Qubes
installation secure. When there is an important security issue, we will issue a
[Qubes Security Bulletin (QSB)](/security/qsb/) via the [Qubes Security
Pack (`qubes-secpack`)](/security/pack/). It is very important to read each new
QSB and follow any user instructions it contains. Most of the time, simply
[updating your system normally](#routine-updates) will be sufficient to obtain
security updates. However, in some cases, special action may be required on
your part, which will be explained in the QSB.

## Routine updates

It is important to keep your Qubes OS system up-to-date to ensure you have the
latest [security updates](#security-updates), as well as the latest
non-security enhancements and bug fixes.

Fully updating your Qubes OS system means updating:

- [dom0](/doc/glossary/#dom0)
- [templates](/doc/glossary/#template)
- [standalones](/doc/glossary/#standalone) (if you have any)

You can accomplish this using the **Qubes Update** tool.

[![Qubes Update](/attachment/doc/r4.0-software-update.png)](/attachment/doc/r4.0-software-update.png)

By default, the Qubes Update tool will appear as an icon in the Notification
Area when updates are available.

[![Qube Updates Available](/attachment/doc/r4.0-qube-updates-available.png)](/attachment/doc/r4.0-qube-updates-available.png)

However, you can also start the tool manually by selecting it in the
Applications Menu under "Qubes Tools." Even if no updates have been detected,
you can use this tool to check for updates manually at any time by selecting
"Enable updates for qubes without known available updates," then selecting all
desired items from the list and clicking "Next."

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
  For information about how templates download updates, please see <a
  href="/doc/how-to-install-software/#why-dont-templates-have-network-access">Why
  donâ€™t templates have network access?</a> and the <a
  href="/doc/how-to-install-software/#updates-proxy">Updates proxy</a>.
</div>

By default, most qubes that are connected to the internet will periodically
check for updates for their parent templates. If updates are available, you
will receive a notification as described above. However, if you have any
templates that do *not* have any online child qubes, you will *not* receive
update notifications for them. Therefore, you should regularly update such
templates manually instead.

## Command-line interface

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
  <b>Warning:</b> Updating with direct commands such as
  <code>qubes-dom0-update</code>, <code>dnf update</code>, and <code>apt
  update</code> is <b>not</b> recommended, since these bypass built-in Qubes OS
  update security measures. Instead, we strongly recommend using the <b>Qubes
  Update</b> tool or its command-line equivalents, as described below. (By
  contrast, <a href="/doc/how-to-install-software/">installing</a> packages
  using direct package manager commands is fine.)
</div>

Advanced users may wish to perform updates via the command-line interface. The
recommended way to do this is by applying the following two Salt states.
**Applying these two Salt states is the same as updating via the Qubes Update
tool.**

 - [update.qubes-dom0](/doc/salt/#updatequbes-dom0)
 - [update.qubes-vm](/doc/salt/#updatequbes-vm)

In your update qube, a terminal window opens that displays the progress of
operations and output as it is logged. At the end of the process, logs are sent
back to dom0. You answer any yes/no prompts in your dom0 terminal window.

Advanced users may also be interested in learning [how to enable the
testing repos](/doc/testing/).

## Upgrading to avoid EOL

The above covers updating *within* a given operating system (OS) release.
Eventually, however, most OS releases will reach **end-of-life (EOL)**, after
which point they will no longer be supported. This applies to Qubes OS itself
as well as OSes used in [templates](/doc/templates/) (and
[standalones](/doc/standalones-and-hvms/), if you have any).

**It's very important that you use only supported releases so that you continue
to receive security updates.** This means that you *must* periodically upgrade
Qubes OS and your templates before they reach EOL. You can always see which
versions of Qubes OS and select templates are supported on the [Supported
Versions](/doc/supported-releases/) page.

In the case of Qubes OS itself, we will make an
[announcement](/news/categories/#releases) when a supported Qubes OS release is
approaching EOL and another when it has actually reached EOL, and we will
provide [instructions for upgrading to the next stable supported Qubes OS
release](/doc/upgrade/).

Periodic upgrades are also important for templates. For example, you might be
using a [Fedora template](/doc/templates/fedora/). The [Fedora
Project](https://getfedora.org/) is independent of the Qubes OS Project. They
set their own
[schedule](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle#Maintenance_Schedule)
for when each Fedora release reaches EOL. You can always find out when an OS
reaches EOL from the upstream project that maintains it. We also pass along any
EOL notices we receive for official template OSes as a convenience to Qubes
users (see [Supported Versions:
Templates](/doc/supported-releases/#templates)).

The one exception to all this is the specific release used for dom0 (not to be
confused with Qubes OS as a whole), which [doesn't have to be
upgraded](/doc/supported-releases/#note-on-dom0-and-eol).
