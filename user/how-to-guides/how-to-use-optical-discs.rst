How to use optical discs
========================


Passthrough reading and recording (a.k.a., “burning”) are not supported
by Qubes OS. This is not a limitation of Xen, which provides scsiback
and scsifront drivers, but of Qubes OS. It will be fixed in the future.

Currently, the only options for reading and recording optical discs
(e.g., CDs, DVDs, BRDs) in Qubes are:

1. Use a USB optical drive.

2. Attach a SATA optical drive to a secondary SATA controller, then
   assign this secondary SATA controller to a VM.

3. Use a SATA optical drive attached to dom0. (**Caution:** This option
   is `potentially dangerous <https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/19075#dom0-precautions>`__.)



To access an optical disc via USB follow the :ref:`typical procedure for attaching a USB device <user/how-to-guides/how-to-use-usb-devices:with the command line tool>`,
then check with the **Qubes Devices** widget to see what device in the
target qube the USB optical drive was attached to. Typically this would
be ``sr0``. For example, if ``sys-usb`` has device ``3-2`` attached to
the ``work`` qube’s ``sr0``, you would mount it with
``mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/removable``. You could also write to a disc with
``wodim -v dev=/dev/sr0 -eject /home/user/Qubes.iso``.
