Emergency backup recovery (v4)
==============================


This page describes how to perform an emergency restore of a backup created on Qubes R4.X (which uses backup format version 4).

The Qubes backup system is designed with emergency disaster recovery in mind. No special Qubes-specific tools are required to access data backed up by Qubes. In the event a Qubes system is unavailable, you can access your data on any GNU/Linux system by following the instructions on this page.

**Important:** You may wish to store a copy of these instructions with your Qubes backups. All Qubes documentation, including this page, is available in plain text format in the `qubes-doc <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-doc>`__ Git repository.

Required ``scrypt`` utility
---------------------------


In Qubes 4.X, backups are encrypted and integrity-protected with `scrypt <https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html>`__. You will need a copy of this utility in order to access your data. Since ``scrypt`` is not pre-installed on every GNU/Linux system, it is strongly recommended that you store a copy of it with your backups. If your distribution has ``scrypt`` packaged (e.g., Debian), you can install the package in the standard way using your distribution’s package manager. Otherwise, you’ll need to obtain a compiled binary (instructions below) or compile the program from source yourself. (Don’t forget to :doc:`verify signatures </project-security/verifying-signatures>` first!) Note that versions of ``scrypt`` up to 1.2.0 (inclusive) do not support the ``-P`` option for easier scripting, which means you’ll need to enter the passphrase for each file separately, instead of using ``echo ... | scrypt``.

Here are instructions for obtaining a compiled ``scrypt`` binary. This example uses an RPM-based system (Fedora), but the same general procedure should work on any GNU/Linux system.

1. If you’re not on Qubes 4.X, :ref:`import and authenticate the Release 4 Signing Key <project-security/verifying-signatures:how to import and authenticate release signing keys>`.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ sudo rpm --import qubes-release-4-signing-key.asc



2. Download the ``scrypt`` RPM.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ dnf download scrypt


   Or, if that doesn’t work:

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ curl -O https://yum.qubes-os.org/r4.0/current/vm/fc28/rpm/scrypt-1.2.1-1.fc28.x86_64.rpm



3. Verify the signature on the ``scrypt`` RPM.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ rpm -K scrypt-*.rpm
         scrypt-*.rpm: digests signatures OK


   The message ``digests signatures OK`` means that both the digest (i.e., the output of a hash function) and PGP signature verification were successful.

4. Install ``rpmdevtools``.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ sudo dnf install rpmdevtools



5. Extract the ``scrypt`` binary from the RPM and make it conveniently available.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ rpmdev-extract scrypt-*.rpm
         [user@restore ~]$ alias scrypt="$PWD/scrypt-*/usr/bin/scrypt"





Emergency recovery instructions
-------------------------------


**Note:** In the following example, the backup file is both *encrypted* and *compressed*.

1. Untar the backup metadata from the main backup file.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ tar -i -xvf qubes-backup-2023-04-05T123456 \
             backup-header backup-header.hmac qubes.xml.000.enc
         backup-header
         backup-header.hmac
         qubes.xml.000.enc



2. Set the backup passphrase environment variable. While this isn’t strictly required, it will be handy later and will avoid saving the passphrase in the shell’s history.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ read -r backup_pass


   Type in your passphrase (it will be visible on screen!) and press Enter.

3. Verify the integrity of ``backup-header`` using ``backup-header.hmac`` (an encrypted *and integrity protected* version of ``backup-header``).

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ set +H
         [user@restore ~]$ echo "backup-header!$backup_pass" |\
             scrypt dec -P backup-header.hmac backup-header.verified && \
             diff -qs backup-header backup-header.verified
         Files backup-header and backup-header.verified are identical


   **Note:** If this command fails, it may be that the backup was tampered with or is in a different format. In the latter case, look inside ``backup-header`` at the ``version`` field. If it contains a value other than ``version=4``, go to the instructions for that format version:

   - :doc:`Emergency Backup Recovery without Qubes (v2) </user/how-to-guides/backup-emergency-restore-v2>`

   - :doc:`Emergency Backup Recovery without Qubes (v3) </user/how-to-guides/backup-emergency-restore-v3>`



4. Read ``backup-header``.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ cat backup-header
         version=4
         encrypted=True
         compressed=True
         compression-filter=gzip
         hmac-algorithm=scrypt
         backup-id=20230405T123455-1234



5. Set ``backup_id`` to the value in the last line of ``backup-header``. (Note that there is a hyphen in ``backup-id`` in the file, whereas there is an underscore in ``backup_id`` in the variable you’re setting.)

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ backup_id=20230405T123455-1234



6. Verify and decrypt, decompress, and extract the ``qubes.xml`` file.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ echo "$backup_id!qubes.xml.000!$backup_pass" |\
             scrypt dec -P qubes.xml.000.enc | gzip -d | tar -xv
         qubes.xml



   - If this pipeline fails, it is likely that the backup is corrupted or has been tampered with.

   - **Note:** If your backup was compressed with a program other than ``gzip``, you must substitute the correct compression program in the command above. This information is contained in ``backup-header`` (see step 4). For example, if your backup is compressed with ``bzip2``, use ``bzip2 -d`` instead of ``gzip -d`` in the command above. You might need to install a package of the same name (in this example, ``bzip2``) through your distribution’s package manager.



7. Search inside of the ``qubes.xml`` file for the ``backup-path`` of the qube whose data you wish to restore. If you install the ``xmlstarlet`` package, the following command will convert ``qubes.xml`` to a friendlier listing for this purpose:

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ xmlstarlet sel -T -t -m //domain \
             -v 'concat(.//property[@name="name"], " ", .//feature[@name="backup-path"])' \
             -n qubes.xml
         
         anon-whonix
         debian-11
         default-mgmt-dvm
         disp2345
         fedora-37
         fedora-37-dvm
         personal vm123/
         sys-firewall
         sys-net
         sys-usb
         sys-whonix
         untrusted
         vault vm321/
         whonix-gw-16
         whonix-ws-16
         whonix-ws-16-dvm
         work


   The example output above shows that the backup file includes a qube named ``personal`` and a qube named ``vault``, with ``backup-path`` values of ``vm123/`` and ``vm321/`` respectively. (Every other listed qube was not selected to be included in the backup file.) Use the corresponding value to untar the necessary data files of the qube:

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ tar -i -xvf qubes-backup-2023-04-05T123456 vm123/



8. Verify and decrypt the backed up data, decompress it, and extract it.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ find vm123/ -name 'private.img.*.enc' | sort -V | while read f_enc; do \
             f_dec=${f_enc%.enc}; \
             echo "$backup_id!$f_dec!$backup_pass" | scrypt dec -P $f_enc || break; \
             done | gzip -d | tar -xv
         vm123/private.img


   If this pipeline fails, it is likely that the backup is corrupted or has been tampered with.
   Also see the note in step 6 about substituting a different compression program for ``gzip``.

9. Mount ``private.img`` and access your data.

   .. code:: console

         [user@restore ~]$ sudo mkdir /mnt/img
         [user@restore ~]$ sudo mount -o loop vm123/private.img /mnt/img/
         [user@restore ~]$ ls /mnt/img/home/user/
         example_data_file.txt
         ...





Success! If you wish to recover data from more than one qube in your backup, simply repeat steps 7, 8, and 9 for each additional qube.
