Installation Guide
==================

<h3>Qubes 4.0.1 Warning</h3>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
    <b>Attention : </b> For those using Debian and Whonix templates, a vulnerability affects the latest stable Qubes OS release. Follow the instructions below to fix it.
</div>

Immediately after installing Qubes 4.0.1, upgrade all of your Debian and Whonix TemplateVMs by executing 
the following commands in a dom0 terminal:

    $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --action=upgrade qubes-template-debian-9
    $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-templates-community --action=upgrade qubes-template-whonix-gw-14
    $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-templates-community --action=upgrade qubes-template-whonix-ws-14

These upgrades are required in order to be protected from the APT update mechanism vulnerability that was announced 
and patched in [QSB #46], which followed the release of Qubes 4.0.1. This method is simpler than the method recommended 
in [QSB #46], and it is just as safe/effective as long as it is performed immediately after installing Qubes OS.

Pre-installation
----------------

<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

Qubes OS has very specific [system requirements].
To ensure compatibility, we strongly recommend using [Qubes-certified hardware].
Other hardware may require you to perform significant troubleshooting.
You may also find it helpful to consult the [Hardware Compatibility List].

Even on supported hardware, you must ensure that [IOMMU-based virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%E2%80%93output_memory_management_unit#Virtualization)
 is activated in the BIOS. Without it, Qubes OS won't be able to enforce isolation. For Intel-based boards, 
 this setting is called Intel Virtualization for Directed I/O (**Intel VT-d**) and for AMD-based boards, it is called 
 AMD I/O Virtualization Technology (or simply **AMD-Vi**). This parameter should be activated in your computer's BIOS, 
 alongside the standard Virtualization (**Intel VT-x**) and AMD Virtualization (**AMD-V**) extensions. This 
 [external guide](https://www.intel.in/content/www/in/en/support/articles/000007139/server-products.html) made for
  Intel-based boards can help you figure out how to enter your BIOS to locate and 
 activate those settings. If those settings are not nested under the Advanced tab, you might find them under the Security tab.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> As Qubes OS has no control over what is happening before it takes control over the hardware, the motherboard firmware, which is responsible for bootstrapping the hardware and checking it, must be trusted, alongside the hardware itself.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
    <b>Tip : </b> It it up to the user to pick a combination of firmware and hardware that is trustworthy enough. One can think 
    of <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">Coreboot</a> and its security-oriented implementation <a href="http://osresearch.net/">Heads</a>, 
    or <a href="https://github.com/merge/skulls">Skulls</a>, which strives to be easy to use. At present, they are only 
    compatible with the Lenovo Thinkpad X230. See <a href="/doc/Qubes-certified hardware">Qubes-certified hardware</a> for other ideas.   
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> Qubes OS is not meant to be installed inside a virtual machine as a guest hypervisor. In other terms, <b>nested virtualization</b> is not supported. In order for a strict 
     compartmentalization to be enforced, Qubes OS needs to be able to manage the hardware directly. 
</div>

<h3>Downloading the ISO</h3>

See the [downloads] page for ISO downloads. Remember, Qubes OS' team have absolutely no control over those servers, so you 
should consider that they might be compromised, or just be serving compromised ISOs because their operators 
decided so, for whatever reason. Always verify the digital signature on the downloaded ISO. Read 
our guide on [verifying signatures] for more information about how to download and verify our PGP keys and verify the downloaded ISO.

<h3>Copying the ISO onto the installation medium</h3>

Once the ISO has been verified as authentic, you should copy it onto the installation medium of your choice, such as
 a DVD or a USB key. (Note that there are important [security considerations] to keep in mind when choosing
  an installation medium.)

If you choose to use a USB drive, copy the ISO onto the
USB device, e.g. using `dd`:

    $ sudo dd if=Qubes-R3-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1048576 && sync

Change `Qubes-R3-x86_64.iso` to the filename of the version you're installing, and change `/dev/sdX` to the correct target device (e.g., `/dev/sdc`). 

Make sure to write to the entire device (e.g., `/dev/sdc`) rather than just a single partition (e.g., `/dev/sdc1`).

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
    <b>Attention : </b> Choosing the wrong device could result in data loss.
</div>

On Windows, you can use the [Rufus] tool to write the ISO to a USB key. MediaTest is not recommended. Be sure to select "DD image" mode (you need to do that **after** selecting the Qubes ISO):

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/rufus-main-boxed.png" height="350">

If you are an advanced user and you would like to customize your installation, please see [Custom Installation]. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> This guide will demonstrate a simple installation using mostly default settings. 
</div>

Installation
------------

<h3>Getting to the boot screen</h3>

Just after you power on your machine, make the Qubes OS medium available to the computer by inserting the DVD or USB key you have previously copied the 
Qubes OS image to. Shortly after the Power-on self-test (POST) is completed, you should be greeted with the Qubes OS boot screen. 

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/boot-screen.png">

From there, you can navigate the boot screen using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Pressing the "Tab" key will reveal options. You can choose one of three options : install Qubes OS ; test this media and install Qubes OS ; troubleshooting. Select the option to test this media and install Qubes OS. 

If the boot screen does not appear, there are several options to troubleshoot. First, try rebooting your computer. If it still loads your currently installed operating
system or does not pick up your installation medium, make sure the boot order is set up appropriately. The process to change the boot order varies depending on
the currently installed system and the motherboard manufacturer. If **Windows 10** is installed on your machine, you may need to follow specific instructions to 
change the boot order. This may require an [advanced reboot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026206/windows-10-find-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings). 
Ideally, you would temporarily select the USB device or DVD drive as a boot up option, so that the next time you boot, your internal storage device will be selected first. 

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
    <b>Tip : </b> After the POST, you may have a chance to temporally pick a booting device. 
</div>

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/boot-order.png">

<h3>The installer home screen</h3>

On the first screen, you are asked to pick the language that will be used during the installation process. When you are done, select "Continue". 

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/welcome-to-qubes-os-installation-screen.png">

Prior to the next screen, a compatibility test runs to check whether IOMMU-virtualization is active or not. If the test fails, a window will pop up. 

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/unsupported-hardware-detected.png">

Do not panic : it may simply indicate that IOMMU-virtualization hasn't been activated in the BIOS. Return to the [Hardware Requirements](/doc/installation-guide/#hardware-requirements) 
section to learn how to activate it. If the setting is not configured correctly, it means that your hardware won't be able to leverage some of Qubes OS security features such as a strict isolation of the network and USB adapter. 

If the test passes, you will reach the Installation summary screen.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> The installer loads Xen right at the beginning, so if you can see the installer's graphical screen and you pass the compatibility check that
    runs immediately after that, Qubes OS is likely to work on your system !
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> Like Fedora, Qubes OS uses the Anaconda installer. Those that are familiar with RPM-based distributions should feel at home. 
</div>

<h3>Installation summary</h3>

The Installation summary screen allows you to change how the end-system will be installed and configured, including localization settings. 
At minimum, you are required to pick a storage device on which Qubes OS will be installed. 

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/installation-summary-not-ready.png">

<h3>Localization</h3>

Let's assume you wish to add a German keyboard layout. Go to Keyboard Layout, press the "Plus" symbol, search for "German" as indicated in the screenshot 
and press "Add". If you want it be your default language, select the "German" entry in the list and press the arrow button. Click on "Done" in the upper left corner and you are ready to go ! 

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/keyboard-layout-selection.png">

The process to select a new language is similar to the process to select a new keyboard layout. Follow the same process in the "Language Support" entry.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/language-support-selection.png">

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> You can have as many keyboard layout and languages as you want. Post-install, you will be able to switch between them and install others. 
</div>

Don't forget to select your time and date by clicking on the Time & Date entry.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/time-and-date.png">

<h3>Software</h3>

Under the Software section, you can change the installation source. As we are demonstrating a simple installation, it is assumed that you are installing Qubes OS using 
a local medium such as a DVD, so this option won't be illustrated.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/add-ons.png">

Go instead to the Software selection tab, where you can choose which software to install alongside Qubes OS. Two Add-Ons are available :

* **Debian 9 (stretch) template** : Install these templates if you wish to base some of your Qubes virtual machines on Debian instead of Fedora. 
* **Whonix** : Install Whonix templates if you wish some of your qubes to be based on Whonix. Whonix let you route your entire network traffic trough Tor if you see fit. For more information about Whonix, have a look at their [website](https://www.whonix.org/). Depending on your threat model, you may need to install Whonix templates right away.

Note that you will also be able to install  Add-Ons after the installation is completed. If you wish for your system to be more lightweight, 
do not hesitate to un-check those options. 

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b> Note : </b> By default, Qubes OS comes preinstalled with the lightweight Xfce desktop environnement for dom0, the main domain. Other desktop environments will be available to you after the installation is completed, although they may not be officially supported. 
</div>

Click on "Done" as soon as you have made your choice to go back to Installation summary screen. 

<h3>Installation destination</h3>

Under the System section, you need to pick the installation destination. For this step to be completed, you need to select which storage device you would like your system to be installed on. By default, only local storage devices are shown. Under the Device Selection section, make sure that you select the correct installation destination. Ensure that your your target destination has a least 32 GiB of free space available.   

For this setup, options will be left unchanged. By default, Qubes OS will partition the system itself using LUKS encryption on top of LVM, and will claim the entire storage device.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/select-storage-device.png">

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i>
    <b>Attention : </b> Any data on the target storage device will be destroyed during the installation process, including any available partitions, so make your selection carefully. 
</div>

As soon as you leave the current window by pressing "Done", Qubes OS will ask you to pick a passphrase to unlock encrypted partition. The passphrase should be complex. Keep it in a safe place. Make sure that your keyboard layout reflects what keyboard you are actually 
using and click on "Done" to start the installation process !

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/select-storage-passphrase.png">

Installing an operating system onto a USB drive can be a convenient and secure method of ensuring that your data is protected and remains portable. 
If you want to install Qubes OS onto a USB drive, just select the USB device as the storage location for the OS. Be advised that a minimum storage of 32 
GB is required and that a *fast* USB 3.0 compatible drive is mandatory to achieve decent performance. Also, bear in mind that the installation process is likely 
to take longer than an installation on a internal storage disk.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> See <a href="/doc/custom-install/">the Custom Installation</a> for more options. 
</div>

You are now ready to go. Press the "Begin Installation" button.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/installation-summary-ready.png">

<h3>Pick your user name</h3>

While the installation is ongoing, a new user needs to be created. Click on "User Creation" to define a new user with administrator privileges and a password. 
Just as for the disk encryption, this password should be complex. The root account is deactivated and should remain as such.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/account-name-and-password.png">

When the installation is complete, click on the "Reboot" button. Don't forget to remove the installation media, otherwise you may end up seeing the Qubes OS boot screen again. 

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>
    <b>Note : </b> By design, Qubes OS is a single user operating system. 
</div>

Post-installation
-----------------

<h3>First boot</h3>

If Qubes OS has been successfully installed, you should see the GRUB menu during the booting process.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/grub-boot-menu.png">

Just after this screen, you will be asked to unlock your storage device. 

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/unlock-storage-device-screen.png">

<h3>Initial Setup</h3>

You're almost done. Before you can start using Qubes OS, some configuration is needed. By default, Qubes OS will create a number of qubes, based 
on Fedora templates or Whonix templates, so that you can have a more ready-to-use environnement from the get-go.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/initial-setup-menu.png">

* **Create default system qubes** : it is recommended to use system qubes as they offer some of the core functionalities brought by Qubes OS, including network isolation and disposable qubes  
* **Create default application qubes** : application qubes are pre-configured qubes meant to be used for specific purposes/categories, such as work or personal. 
* **Create Whonix Gateway and Workstation qubes** : in order to be able to use Tor for dedicated qubes, you need this option to be activated. 
    * **Enabling system and template updates over the Tor anonymity network using Whonix** : this option allows the use of Tor system-wide rather than only for specific qubes.  
* **Create USB qube holding all USB controllers** : just like the network qube for the network stack, the USB qube allows to capture the USB controller and to manage USB devices through it. 
    * Use sys-net qube for both networking and USB devices : **???**
* **Do not configure anything** : If you would rather not configure anything for now, check this box.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/initial-setup-menu-configuration.png">

When you are satisfied with you choices, click on "Done". Pre-selected qubes will be installed and configured, which can take up to 15 minutes. 

After the configuration is done, you will be greeted by a login screen. Enter your password and log in.

<img src="/attachment/wiki/InstallationGuide/login-screen.png">

Congratulations, you are now ready to use Qubes OS !
