=========================
KDE (desktop environment)
=========================

.. warning::

      This page is intended for advanced users.

Installation
------------


Prior to R3.2, KDE was the default desktop environment in Qubes. Beginning with R3.2, however, :doc:`XFCE is the new default desktop environment </developer/releases/3_2/release-notes>`. Nonetheless, it is still possible to install KDE by issuing this command in dom0:

.. code:: console

      $ sudo qubes-dom0-update kde-settings-qubes


You may notice some warnings and errors in the installation - it is safe to ignore these.

After the installation is complete log out. At the top of the log in screen is a small icon with *X* on it - if you click on it you will see choices between Xfce and Plasma. Select the Plasma(X11) option, and log in - you will see that Plasma (the KDE desktop environment) loads.

KDE is very customisable, and there is a range of widgets to use. If you want to use the Menu widget, then you must edit ``/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/55xfce-qubes.sh`` as follows:

.. code:: bash

      #!/usr/bin/sh

      # Use Qubes provided menu instead of default XFCE one
      if [ "$XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP" = "KDE" ]; then
      XDG_MENU_PREFIX="kf5-"
      else
      XDG_MENU_PREFIX="qubes-"
      fi
      export XDG_MENU_PREFIX



This allows you to edit the menu as you will. When editing the Menu *DO NOT use the option under “Edit->Restore to System Menu”*

Login manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^


You can also change your default login manager (lightdm) to the new KDE default: sddm

- first you need to edit the ``/etc/sddm.conf`` to make sure if the custom X parameter is set according to Qubes needs:

  .. code:: kconfig

        [XDisplay]
        ServerArguments=-nolisten tcp -background none



- disable the lightdm service:

  .. code:: console

        $ sudo systemctl disable lightdm



- enable the sddm service:

  .. code:: console

        $ sudo systemctl enable sddm



- reboot



If you encounter performance issues with KDE, try switching back to LightDM.

Window Management
-----------------


You can set each window’s position and size like this:

.. code:: text

      Right click title bar --> More actions --> Special window settings...

        Window matching tab
          Window class (application): Exact Match: <vm_name>
          Window title: Substring Match: <partial or full program name>

        Size & Position tab
          [x] Position: Apply Initially: x,y
          [x] Size: Apply Initially: x,y


You can also use ``kstart`` to control virtual desktop placement like this:

.. code:: console

      $ kstart --desktop 3 --windowclass <vm_name> -q --tray -a <vm_name> '<run_program_command>'



(Replace “3” with whichever virtual desktop you want the window to be on.)

This can be useful for creating a simple shell script which will set up your workspace the way you like.

Removal
-------


If you decide to remove KDE do **not** use ``dnf remove @kde-desktop-qubes``. You will almost certainly break your system.

The safest way to remove (most of) KDE is:

.. code:: console

      $ sudo dnf remove kdelibs plasma-workspace
