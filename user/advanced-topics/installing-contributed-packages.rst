Installing contributed packages
===============================


*This page is for users who wish to install contributed packages. If you want to contribute a package, please see* :doc:`package contributions </developer/general/package-contributions>` *.*

Qubes OS contributed packages are available under the
`QubesOS-contrib <https://github.com/QubesOS-contrib/>`__ GitHub
Project. This is a place where our community can :doc:`contribute Qubes OS related packages, additions and various customizations </developer/general/package-contributions>`.

Installing the repositories
---------------------------


If you want to install one of these packages, first you need to enable
the repository in your system (dom0 and/or templates). This can be done
by installing the ``qubes-repo-contrib`` package. This package includes
the repository definition and keys necessary to download, verify, and
install `QubesOS-contrib <https://github.com/QubesOS-contrib/>`__
packages.

In dom0, use ``qubes-dom0-update``:



.. code:: bash

      sudo qubes-dom0-update qubes-repo-contrib


In a Fedora-based template, use ``dnf``:



.. code:: bash

      sudo dnf install qubes-repo-contrib


In a Debian-based template, use ``apt``:



.. code:: bash

      sudo apt update && sudo apt install qubes-repo-contrib


The new repository definition will be in the usual location for your
distro, and it will follow the naming pattern ``qubes-contrib-*``,
depending on your Qubes release and whether it is in dom0 or a template.
For example, in a Fedora template on Qubes 4.0, the new repository
definition would be:

.. code:: bash

      /etc/yum.repos.d/qubes-contrib-vm-r4.0.repo



Installing packages
-------------------


After you’ve installed the repositories, you can install contributed
packages.

**Note:** The first time you install a contrib package in dom0, you must
use the ``--clean`` flag.

For example, to install ``qvm-screenshot-tool`` in dom0:



.. code:: bash

      sudo qubes-dom0-update --clean qvm-screenshot-tool


Please see the package’s README for specific installation and setup
instructions.
