title: How to make any file persistent (bind-dirs)
---

## What are bind-dirs? ##

With [bind-dirs](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-agent-linux/blob/master/vm-systemd/bind-dirs.sh)
any arbitrary files or folders can be made persistent in app qubes.

## What is it useful for? ##

In an app qube all of the file system comes from the template except `/home`, `/usr/local`, and `/rw`.
This means that changes in the rest of the filesystem are lost when the app qube is shutdown.
bind-dirs provides a mechanism whereby files usually taken from the template can be persisted across reboots.

For example, in Whonix, [Tor's data dir `/var/lib/tor` has been made persistent in the TemplateBased ProxyVM sys-whonix](https://github.com/Whonix/qubes-whonix/blob/8438d13d75822e9ea800b9eb6024063f476636ff/usr/lib/qubes-bind-dirs.d/40_qubes-whonix.conf#L5)
In this way sys-whonix can benefit from the Tor anonymity feature 'persistent Tor entry guards' but does not have to be a standalone.

## How to use bind-dirs.sh? ##

In this example, we want to make `/var/lib/tor` persistent. Enter all of the following commands in your app qube.

1. Make sure the directory `/rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d` exists.

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d
   ```

2. Create the file `/rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf` with root permissions, if it doesn't already exist.

   ```
   sudo touch /rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf
   ```

3. Add a line to `/rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf` that appends a folder or file to the `binds` variable.

   ```
   binds+=( '/var/lib/tor' )
   ```

4. Save.

5. If the directory you wish to make persistent doesn't exist in the template on which the app qube is based, you'll need to create the directory (with its full path) under `/rw/bind-dirs` in the app qube. For example, if `/var/lib/tor` didn't exist in the template, then you would execute the following command in your app qube:

   ```
   sudo mkdir -p /rw/bind-dirs/var/lib/tor
   ```

6. (optional) If the directory you want to persist across reboots (`/var/lib/tor` in this case) needs special ownership and permissions, make sure the directory you created just under `/rw/bind-dirs/` has the same ones (using the commands `chown` and `chmod`, respectively).

7. Reboot the app qube.

8. Done.

From now on, all files in the `/var/lib/tor` directory will persist across reboots.

You can make as many files or folders persist as you want simply by making multiple entries in the `50_user.conf` file, each on a separate line.
For example, if you added the file `/etc/tor/torrc` to the `binds` variable, any modifications to *that* file would also persist across reboots.

```
binds+=( '/var/lib/tor' )
binds+=( '/etc/tor/torrc' )
```

## Other Configuration Folders ##

* `/usr/lib/qubes-bind-dirs.d` (lowest priority, for packages)
* `/etc/qubes-bind-dirs.d`  (intermediate priority, for template wide configuration)
* `/rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d` (highest priority, for per VM configuration)

## How does it work? ##

bind-dirs.sh is called at startup of an app qube, and configuration files in the above configuration folders are parsed to build a bash array.
Files or folders identified in the array are copied to `/rw/bind-dirs` if they do not already exist there, and are then bind mounted over the original files/folders.

Creation of the files and folders in `/rw/bind-dirs` should be automatic the first time the app qube is restarted after configuration.

If you want to circumvent this process, you can create the relevant file structure under `/rw/bind-dirs` and make any changes at the same time that you perform the configuration, before reboot.
Note that you must create the full folder structure under `/rw/bind-dirs` - e.g you would have to create `/rw/bind-dirs/var/lib/tor`

## Limitations ##

* Files that exist in the template root image cannot be deleted in the app qubes root image using bind-dirs.sh.
* Re-running `sudo /usr/lib/qubes/init/bind-dirs.sh` without a previous `sudo /usr/lib/qubes/init/bind-dirs.sh umount` does not work.
* Running `sudo /usr/lib/qubes/init/bind-dirs.sh umount` after boot (before shutdown) is probably not sane and nothing can be done about that.
* Many editors create a temporary file and copy it over the original file. If you have bind mounted an individual file this will break the mount.
Any changes you make will not survive a reboot. If you think it likely you will want to edit a file, then either include the parent directory in bind-dirs rather than the file, or perform the file operation on the file in `/rw/bind-dirs`.
* Some files are altered when a qube boots - e.g. `/etc/hosts`.
If you try to use bind-dirs on such files you may break your qube in unpredictable ways.
You can add persistent rules to `/etc/hosts` using [`/rw/config/rc.local`](/doc/config-files)

## How to remove binds from bind-dirs.sh? ##

`binds` is actually just a bash variable (an array) and the bind-dirs.sh configuration folders are sourced as bash snippets in lexical order.
Therefore if you wanted to remove an existing entry from the `binds` array, you could do that by using a lexically higher configuration file.
For example, if you wanted to make `/var/lib/tor` non-persistent in `sys-whonix` without manually editing `/usr/lib/qubes-bind-dirs.d/40_qubes-whonix.conf`, you could use the following in:

`/rw/config/qubes-bind-dirs.d/50_user.conf`

~~~
binds=( "${binds[@]/'/var/lib/tor'}" )
~~~

(Editing `/usr/lib/qubes-bind-dirs.d/40_qubes-whonix.conf` directly is strongly discouraged, since such changes get lost when that file is changed in the package on upgrades.)
