Config files
============


Qubes-specific VM config files
------------------------------


These files are placed in ``/rw``, which survives a VM restart. That
way, they can be used to customize a single VM instead of all VMs based
on the same template. The scripts here all run as root.

- ``/rw/config/rc.local`` - script runs at VM startup. Good place to
  change some service settings, replace config files with its copy
  stored in ``/rw/config``, etc. Example usage:

  .. code:: bash

        # Store bluetooth keys in /rw to keep them across VM restarts
        rm -rf /var/lib/bluetooth
        ln -s /rw/config/var-lib-bluetooth /var/lib/bluetooth



  .. code:: bash

        # Add entry to /etc/hosts
        echo '127.0.0.1 example.com' >> /etc/hosts



- ``/rw/config/qubes-ip-change-hook`` - script runs in NetVM after
  every external IP change and on “hardware” link status change.

- In ProxyVMs (or app qubes with ``qubes-firewall`` service enabled),
  scripts placed in the following directories will be executed in the
  listed order followed by ``qubes-firewall-user-script`` at start up.
  Good place to write custom firewall rules.

  .. code:: bash

        /etc/qubes/qubes-firewall.d
        /rw/config/qubes-firewall.d
        /rw/config/qubes-firewall-user-script



- ``/rw/config/suspend-module-blacklist`` - list of modules (one per
  line) to be unloaded before system goes to sleep. The file is used
  only in a VM with PCI devices attached. Intended for use with
  problematic device drivers.

- In NetVMs/ProxyVMs, scripts placed in ``/rw/config/network-hooks.d``
  will be ran when configuring Qubes interfaces. For each script, the
  ``command``, ``vif``, ``vif_type`` and ``ip`` is passed as arguments
  (see ``/etc/xen/scripts/vif-route-qubes``). For example, consider a
  PV app qube ``work`` with IP ``10.137.0.100`` and ``sys-firewall`` as
  NetVM. Assuming it’s Xen domain id is arbitrary ``12`` then, the
  following script located at
  ``/rw/config/network-hooks.d/hook-100.sh`` in ``sys-firewall``:

  .. code:: bash

        #!/bin/bash
        
        command="$1"
        vif="$2"
        vif_type="$3"
        ip="$4"
        
        if [ "$ip" == '10.137.0.100' ]; then
            case "$command" in
                online)
                    ip route add 192.168.0.100 via 10.137.0.100
                    ;;
                offline)
                    ip route del 192.168.0.100
                    ;;
            esac
        fi


  will be executed with arguments ``online vif12.0 vif 10.137.0.100``
  when starting ``work``. Please note that in case of an HVM, the
  script will be called twice - once with vif_type ``vif``, then with
  vif_type ``vif_ioemu`` (and different interface names). As long as
  the ioemu interface exists, it should be preferred (up to the hook
  script). When the VM decides to use a PV interface (vif_type
  ``vif``), the ioemu one will be unplugged.



Note that scripts need to be executable (``chmod +x``) to be used.

Also, take a look at :doc:`bind-dirs </user/advanced-topics/bind-dirs>` for instructions on
how to easily modify arbitrary system files in an app qube and have
those changes persist.

GUI and audio configuration in dom0
-----------------------------------


The GUI configuration file ``/etc/qubes/guid.conf`` in one of a few not
managed by ``qubes-prefs`` or the Qubes Manager tool. Sample config
(included in default installation):

.. code:: bash

      # Sample configuration file for Qubes GUI daemon
      #  For syntax go https://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig_manual.html
      
      global: {
        # default values
        #allow_fullscreen = false;
        #override_redirect_protection = true;
        #allow_utf8_titles = false;
        #secure_copy_sequence = "Ctrl-Shift-c";
        #secure_paste_sequence = "Ctrl-Shift-v";
        #windows_count_limit = 500;
        #audio_low_latency = true;
        #log_level = 1;
        #trayicon_mode = "border1";
        #startup_timeout = 45;
      };
      
      # most of setting can be set per-VM basis
      
      VM: {
        work: {
          allow_utf8_titles = true;
        };
        video-vm: {
          allow_fullscreen = true;
        };
      };



Currently supported settings:

- ``allow_fullscreen`` - allow VM to request its windows to go
  fullscreen (without any colorful frame).
  **Note:** Regardless of this setting, you can always put a window
  into fullscreen mode in Xfce4 using the trusted window manager by
  right-clicking on a window’s title bar and selecting “Fullscreen”.
  This functionality should still be considered safe, since a VM window
  still can’t voluntarily enter fullscreen mode. The user must select
  this option from the trusted window manager in dom0. To exit
  fullscreen mode from here, press ``alt`` + ``space`` to bring up the
  title bar menu again, then select “Leave Fullscreen”.

- ``allow_utf8_titles`` - allow the use of UTF-8 in window titles;
  otherwise, non-ASCII characters are replaced by an underscore.

- ``secure_copy_sequence`` and ``secure_paste_sequence`` - key
  sequences used to trigger secure copy and paste.

- ``audio_low_latency`` - force low-latency audio mode (about 40ms
  compared to 200-500ms by default). Note that this will cause much
  higher CPU usage in dom0. It’s enabled by default, disabling it may
  save CPU in dom0.

- ``trayicon_mode`` - defines the trayicon coloring mode. Options are -
  ``bg`` - color full icon background to the VM color - ``border1`` -
  add 1px border at the icon edges - ``border2`` - add 1px border 1px
  from the icon edges - ``tint`` - tinttint icon to the VM color, can
  be used with additional modifiers (you can enable multiple of them) -
  ``tint+border1,tint+border2`` - same as tint, but also add a border -
  ``tint+saturation50`` - same as tint, but reduce icon saturation by
  50% - ``tint+whitehack`` - same as tint, but change white pixels
  (0xffffff) to almost-white (0xfefefe)

- ``log level`` - defines the log options logs can take. It can have a
  value of 0 (only errors), 1 (some basic messages), and 2 (debug).

- ``startup_timeout`` - The timeout for startup.
