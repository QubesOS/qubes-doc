## Qubes-certified options

The configuration options required for Qubes certification are detailed below.

### Screen size

- Certified: 14 inch

**Note:** The 14-inch model (V540TU) and the 16-inch model (V560TU) are two separate products. [The 16-inch model has already been certified.](/news/2024/09/17/novacustom-v56-series-qubes-certified/)

### Screen resolution

- Certified: Full HD+ (1920 x 1200)
- Certified: 2.8K (2880 x 1800)

### Processor and graphics

- Certified: Intel Core Ultra 5 Processor 125H, Intel Arc iGPU with AI Boost
- Certified: Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor 155H, Intel Arc iGPU with AI Boost
- The Nvidia discrete GPU options are not currently certified.

### Memory

- Certified: Any configuration with at least 16 GB of memory

### Storage

- Certified: All of the available options in these sections

### Personalization

- This section is merely cosmetic and therefore does not affect certification.

### Firmware options

- Qubes OS does not currently support UEFI secure boot.
- The option to be kept up to date with firmware updates is merely an email notification service and therefore does not affect certification.
- The coreboot+Heads option is not currently certified. This option is a separate firmware variant. As such, it requires a separate certification process, which we expect to occur in the future.
- Disabling Intel Management Engine (HAP disabling) does not affect certification.

### Operating system

- Certified: Qubes OS 4.2.4 or newer (within Release 4).
- Releases older than 4.2.4 are not certified.
- You may choose either to have NovaCustom preinstall Qubes OS for you, or you may choose to install Qubes OS yourself. This choice does not affect certification.

### Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

- Certified: Intel AX-210/211 (non vPro) Wi-Fi module 2.4 Gbps, 802.11AX/Wi-Fi6E + Bluetooth 5.3
- Certified: Intel BE200 (non vPro) Wi-Fi module 5.8 Gbps, 802.11BE/Wi-Fi7 + Bluetooth 5.42
- Certified: No Wi-Fi chip -- no Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connection possible (only with USB adapter)

## Disclaimers

- In order for Wi-Fi to function properly, `sys-net` must currently be based on a Fedora template. The firmware package in Debian templates is currently too old for the certified Wi-Fi cards.
- Currently requires `kernel-latest`: If you install Qubes OS yourself, you must select the `Install Qubes OS RX using kernel-latest` option on the GRUB menu when booting the installer. This non-default kernel option is currently required for the NovaCustom V54 Series to function properly.
- Due to a [known bug](https://github.com/Dasharo/dasharo-issues/issues/976), the bottom-right USB-C port is currently limited to USB 2.0 speeds.
