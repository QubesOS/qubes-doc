### Notes on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth options

- When viewed in a Linux environment with `lspci`, the "Killer (Intel) Wireless-AX 1675x M.2 Wi-Fi module 802.11ax/Wi-Fi 6E + Bluetooth 5.3" device displays the model number "AX210." However, according to its [Intel Ark entry](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/211485/intel-killer-wifi-6e-ax1675-xw.html) (in the "Product Brief" file), they are actually the same Wi-Fi module.

- Similarly, when viewed in a Linux environment with `lspci`, the "Blob-free: Qualcomm Atheros QCNFA222 Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n + Bluetooth 4.0" device displays the model number "AR9462," which seems to be just the Wi-Fi chip model number, whereas "QCNFA222" seems to be the model number of the whole device (which include Bluetooth). Meanwhile, the Bluetooth device presents itself as "IMC Networks Device 3487."

- The term "blob-free" is used in different ways. In practice, being "blob-free" generally does *not* mean that the device does not use any closed-source firmware "blobs." Rather, it means that the device comes with firmware *preinstalled* so that it does not have to be loaded from the operating system. In theory, the preinstalled firmware could be open-source, but as far as we know, that is not the case with this particular Atheros Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module. (Qualcomm has published firmware source code in the past, but only for other device models, as far as we are aware.) Meanwhile, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) [considers](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.en.html#boundary) unmodifiable preinstalled firmware to be part of the hardware, hence they regard such hardware as "blob-free" from a software perspective. While common usage of the term "blob-free" often follows the FSF's interpretation, it is worthwhile for Qubes users who are concerned about closed-source firmware to understand the nuance.
