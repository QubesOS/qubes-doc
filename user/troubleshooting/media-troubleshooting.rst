Can't play media videos in a VM due to missing codecs
-----------------------------------------------------


If you’re having trouble playing a video file in a qube, you’re probably
missing the required codecs. The easiest way to resolve this is to
install VLC Media Player and use that to play your video files. You can
do this in multiple different template distros by following the
instructions :ref:`here <introduction/faq:how do i play video files?>`.

Video lagging
-------------


Playing videos may cause lags since software decoding uses a lot of CPU.

Depending on your video player, there are some settings that may
smoothen video plays:

- If using VLC media player, go to Tools–> Preferences –> Video –>
  Output. By default, the Output is set to “Automatic”. Go through the
  list and try out other output options to see if any makes videos run
  smoother.

- If using mpv media player, you may be able to improve performance by
  entering ``mpv --profile=sw-fast --vo=x11`` in a terminal.

- For video lags when playing videos from a browser, disable hardware
  acceleration in the browser. If the problem arises when watching
  streams, it may be smoother to use ``streamlink`` to view streams in
  mpv instead of using the browser.
