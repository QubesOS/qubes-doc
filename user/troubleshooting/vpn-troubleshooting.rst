VPN troubleshooting
===================


Tips
----


- If using qubes-vpn, check the VPN service’s log in the VPN VM by
  running:

  .. code:: bash

        sudo journalctl -u qubes-vpn-handler



- Always test your basic VPN connection before adding scripts.

- Test DNS: Ping a familiar domain name from an appVM. It should print
  the IP address for the domain.

- Use ``iptables -L -v`` and ``iptables -L -v -t nat`` to check
  firewall rules. The latter shows the critical PR-QBS chain that
  enables DNS forwarding.



VPN does not reconnect after suspend
------------------------------------


This applies when using OpenVPN.

After suspend/resume, OpenVPN may not automatically reconnect. In order
to get it to work, you must kill the OpenVPN process and restart it.

VPN stuck at "Ready to start link"
----------------------------------


After setting up OpenVPN and restarting the VM, you may be repeatedly
getting the popup “Ready to start link”, but the VPN isn’t connected.

To figure out the root of the problem, check the VPN logs in
``/var/logs/syslog``. The log may reveal issues like missing OpenVPN
libraries, which you can then install.
