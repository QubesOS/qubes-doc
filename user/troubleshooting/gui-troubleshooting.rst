GUI troubleshooting
===================


Can't click on anything after connecting 4k external display
------------------------------------------------------------


When you connect a 4K external display, you may be unable to click on
anything but a small area in the upper-right corner.

When a qube starts, a fixed amount of RAM is allocated to the graphics
buffer called video RAM. This buffer needs to be at least as big as the
whole desktop, accounting for all displays that are or will be connected
to the machine. By default, it is as much as needed for the current
display and an additional full HD (FHD) display (1920×1080 8 bit/channel
RGBA). This logic fails when the machine has primary display in FHD
resolution and, after starting some qubes, a 4K display is connected. If
the buffer is too small, and internal desktop resize fails.

The solution to this problem is to increase the minimum size of the
video RAM buffer, as explained in :ref:`GUI Configuration <user/advanced-topics/gui-configuration:video ram adjustment for high-resolution displays>`.

Screen blanks / Weird computer glitches like turning partially black or black boxes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You may encountering seemingly random screen blanking while using Qubes,
where the screen will black and shows the logon screen, yet, only the
active window will show when you move the mouse or use the keyboard.
Sometimes, you will get random black screens or black boxes.

Similarly, while working, the XScreenSaver dialog may pop up (indicating
the screen is locked) and the screen goes black. However, the screen is
not locked, and you have to move a window to redraw the screen.

If you are experiencing the any of the above symptoms, try disabling the
window compositor:

``Q → System Tools → Window Manager Tweaks → Compositor → uncheck “Enable display compositing”``

Post installation, screen goes black and freezes following LUKS decryption
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


After installing Qubes, you may experience a black screen after entering
your LUKS decryption password. To fix the problem, use your preferred
text editor (``nano`` works) to edit
``/mnt/sysimage/boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen.cfg``, adding the ``efi=no-rs``
option to the end of the ``options= line``. For example:

.. code:: bash

      [4.14.18-1.pvops.qubes.x86_64]
      options=loglvl=all dom0_mem=min:1024M dom0_mem=max:4096M iommu=no-igfx ucode=scan efi=no-rs



Note that the ``/mnt/sysimage/boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen.cfg`` path applies
when running from the installer (either directly after installation,
before the reboot, or by starting the installer again in recovery mode).
On the actual installed system, the file to edit is
``/boot/efi/EFI/qubes/xen.cfg`` – but it may be hard to access directly
when your system won’t boot.

Can start VM, but can't launch any applications
-----------------------------------------------


If you can start your VM, but can’t launch any applications, then you
need to fix the issues from the ``VM console``, accessible from xen
through:

.. code:: bash

      qvm-start <VMname> # Make sure the VM is started
      qvm-console-dispvm <VMname>


After launching a VM console using ``qvm-console-dispvm``, you may look
at the ``qubes-gui-agent`` service state with:

.. code:: bash

      systemctl status -l qubes-gui-agent



If the service is in a failed state, you should see some messages on why
it failed.

Another helpful place to look into is ``/home/user/.xsession-errors``,
which may also contain some hints what is wrong.

Disable audited messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


During troubleshooting, you may be getting a lot of ‘audit’ messages
which make the log very noisy. To disable audited messages, you need to
edit your VM kernel parameters:

.. code:: bash

      previous_kernel_parameters=$(qvm-prefs --get <VMname> kernelopts) # Get current kernel parameters
      qvm-prefs --set <VMname> kernelopts "<previous_kernel_parameters> audit=0"


Then, restart your VM.

Once your troubleshooting is done, don’t forget to remove this kernel
parameters, it makes troubleshooting VMs not starting easier.
