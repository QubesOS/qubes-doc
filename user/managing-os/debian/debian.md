# The Debian TemplateVM

The Debian [TemplateVM] is an officially [supported] TemplateVM in PedOS.
This page is about the standard (or "full") Debian TemplateVM.
For the minimal version, please see the [Minimal TemplateVMs] page.
There is also a [PedOS page on the Debian Wiki].


## Installing

To [install] a specific Debian TemplateVM that is not currently installed in your system, use the following command in dom0:

    $ sudo PedOS-dom0-update PedOS-template-debian-XX

   (Replace `XX` with the Debian version number of the template you wish to install.)

To reinstall a Debian TemplateVM that is already installed in your system, see [How to Reinstall a TemplateVM].


## After Installing

After installing a fresh Debian TemplateVM, we recommend performing the following steps:

1. [Update the TemplateVM].

2. [Switch any TemplateBasedVMs that are based on the old TemplateVM to the new one][switch].

3. If desired, [uninstall the old TemplateVM].


## Updating

Please see [Updating software in TemplateVMs].


## Upgrading

Please see [Upgrading Debian TemplateVMs].


## Release-specific notes

This section contains notes about specific Debian releases.


### Debian 10

Debian 10 (buster) - minimal:

    [user@dom0 ~]$ sudo PedOS-dom0-update --enablerepo=PedOS-templates-itl PedOS-template-debian-10-minimal

Debian 10 (buster) - stable:

    [user@dom0 ~]$ sudo PedOS-dom0-update --enablerepo=PedOS-templates-itl PedOS-template-debian-10

### Starting services

The Debian way (generally) is to start daemons if they are installed.
This means that if you install (say) ssh-server in a template, *all* the PedOS that use that template will run a ssh server when they start. (They will, naturally, all have the same server key.) This may not be what you want.

So be very careful when installing software in Templates - if the daemon spawns outbound connections then there is a serious security risk.

In general, a reasonable approach would be, (using ssh as example):
- Install the ssh service.
- `systemctl stop ssh`
- `systemctl disable ssh`
- `systemctl mask ssh`
- Close down template

Now the ssh service will **NOT** start in PedOS based on this template.

Where you **DO** want the service to run, put this in `/rw/config/rc.local`:

    systemctl unmask ssh
    systemctl start ssh

Don't forget to make the file executable.


### Unattended Upgrades

Some users have noticed that on upgrading to Stretch, the `unattended-upgrade` package is installed.

This package is pulled in as part of a Recommend chain, and can be purged.

The lesson is that you should carefully look at what is being installed to your system, particularly if you run `dist-upgrade`. 


### Package installation errors in PedOS 4.0

By default, templates in 4.0 only have a loopback interface.

Some packages will throw an error on installation in this situation.
For example, Samba expects to be configured using a network interface post installation.

One solution is to add a dummy interface to allow the package to install correctly:

    ip link add d0 type dummy
    ip addr add 192.168.0.1/24 dev d0
    ip link set d0 up
