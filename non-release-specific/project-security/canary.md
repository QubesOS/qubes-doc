A **Qubes canary** is a security announcement periodically issued by the [Qubes
security team](/security/#qubes-security-team) through the [Qubes security
pack](/security/pack/) consisting of several statements to the effect that the
signers of the canary have not been compromised. The idea is that, as long as
signed canaries including such statements continue to be published, all is
well. However, if the canaries should suddenly cease, if one or more signers
begin declining to sign them, or if the included statements change
significantly without plausible explanation, then this may indicate that
something has gone wrong.

The name originates from the practice in which miners would bring caged
canaries into coal mines. If the level of methane gas in the mine reached a
dangerous level, the canary would die, indicating to miners that they should
evacuate. See [Wikipedia: warrant
canary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary) for more information, but
bear in mind that Qubes Canaries are not strictly limited to legal warrants.
