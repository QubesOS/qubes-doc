Thank you for your interest in contributing to `qubes-doc`, the Qubes OS

[Documentation Guidelines] before you begin writing. These guidelines are
important to maintaining high quality documentation, and following them will

If you want to preview your changes locally, you'll want to look at the
[qubesos.github.io repository's README][readme]. After you run `git clone
--recursive`, change into `qubesos.github.io/_doc` and pull in the changes you
made to this repository. (You can either copy the files directly in or, if
