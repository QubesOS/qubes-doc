**Legal notice:**

The usage of penetration testing tools outside your own laboratory environment requires the permission of the organization you attack. Penetration testing without such a permission can have legal consequences.

To avoid such legal conflicts please refer to the [EC-Council: Code of Ethics](https://www.eccouncil.org/Support/code-of-ethics).

Penetration Testing
===================

[Penetration testing](https://www.aptive.co.uk/penetration-testing/) also known as pen testing, is the process of testing a computer system, network or application to identify vulnerabilities and security issues. After discovery, vulnerabilities are safely exploited, confirming if the vulnerability exists. The testing process is manual and removes false positives typically returned by automated tools and vulnerability scans.

Using Qubes OS to host a "hacking" laboratory
