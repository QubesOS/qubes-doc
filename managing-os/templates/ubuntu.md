Ubuntu template(s)
==================

If you like to use Ubuntu Linux distribution in your AppVMs, you can build and
install one of available Ubuntu templates. Those template currently are not
available in ready to use binary packages, because Canonical does not allow
to redistribute a modified Ubuntu. The redistribution is not allowed by their
[Intellectual property rights policy](http://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/intellectual-property-policy).


Install
-------

It can built using [Qubes Builder](/en/doc/qubes-builder/). You can also access its
documentation in the [source code
repository](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-builder/blob/master/README.md).

To quickly prepare the builder configuration, you can use `setup` script
available in the repository - it will interactively ask you which templates you
want to build.
