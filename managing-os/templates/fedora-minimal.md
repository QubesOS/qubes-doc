Fedora - minimal
================

The template weighs only about 300MB and has most of the stuff cut off, except for minimal X and xterm. It is really just a barebone and not even usable in this form - but you can customize it to meet your needs. You can find some usage examples in the section below.  



Install
-------

It can be installed via the following command:

~~~
[user@dom0 ~]$ sudo qubes-dom0-update qubes-template-fedora-23-minimal
~~~

Download will take a while and there will be no progress indicator.

Usage
-----

It is a good idea to clone the original template, and make any changes in the new clone instead:

~~~
[user@dom0 ~]$ qvm-clone fedora-23-minimal <your new template name>
~~~

The sudo package is not installed by default, so let's install it:

~~~
[user@F23-Minimal ~]$ su -
[user@F23-Minimal ~]$ dnf install sudo
~~~

The rsyslog logging service is not installed by default. All logging is now being handled by the systemd journal. Users requiring the rsyslog service should install it manually.

To access the journald log, use the `journalctl` command.

### as a NetVM

If you want to use this template to for standard NetVMs you should install some more packeges:

~~~
[user@F21-Minimal ~]$ sudo dnf install NetworkManager NetworkManager-wifi network-manager-applet  wireless-tools dbus-x11 dejavu-sans-fonts tinyproxy
~~~

And maybe some more optional but useful packages as well:

~~~
[user@F21-Minimal ~]$ sudo dnf install pciutils vim-minimal less tcpdump telnet psmisc nmap nmap-ncat gnome-keyring
~~~

If your network device needs some firmware then you should also install the corresponding packages as well. The `lspci` and `dnf search firmware` command will help to choose the right one :)

### as a ProxyVM

If you want to use this template as a ProxyVM you may want to install even more packages

#### Firewall

This template is now ready to use for a standard firewall VM.

#### VPN

The needed packages depend on the VPN technology. The `dnf search "NetworkManager VPN plugin"` command may help you to choose the right one. You should also install the corresponding GNOME related packages as well.

#### TOR
