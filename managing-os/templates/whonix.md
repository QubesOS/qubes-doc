Whonix template(s)
==================

Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security. It's
based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux and security by isolation.
Its primary isolation mechanism is VirtualBox, but now it is also possible to
run it on top of Qubes OS!

Whonix template(s) are another Qubes community contribution. Currently Whonix actively maintains those templates.
