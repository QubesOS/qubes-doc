Known issues
------------

* Installation image does not fit on DVD, requires either DVD DL, or USB stick (5GB or more)

* Windows Tools: `qvm-block` does not work

* Some icons in the Qubes Manager application might not be drawn correctly when using the Xfce4 environment in Dom0. If this bothers you, please use the KDE environment instead.

* USB mouse (in the case of USB VM) does not work at first system startup (just after completing firstboot). Workaround: restart the system.

* For other known issues take a look at [our tickets](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+3.1%22+label%3Abug)

It is advised to install updates just after system installation to apply bug fixes for (some of) the above problems.

Upgrading
---------

### From R3.0

The easiest and safest way to upgrade to Qubes R3.1 is to install it from
scratch and use [qubes backup and restore tools](/doc/backup-restore/) for
migrating of all of the user VMs.

Users of Qubes R3.0 can upgrade using [experimental
procedure](/doc/upgrade-to-r3.1/).

### From R2 or earlier

When upgrading from earlier versions the easiest and safest way is to install
it from scratch and use [qubes backup and restore tools](/doc/backup-restore/)
for migrating of all of the user VMs.

Alternatively you can [upgrade to R3.0
using](/doc/releases/3.0/release-notes/#upgrading) first, then follow the
instructions above. This will be time consuming process.
