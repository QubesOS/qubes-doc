Known issues
------------

* [Fedora 23 reached EOL in December 2016](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life). There is a [manual procedure to upgrade your VMs](/news/2018/01/06/fedora-26-upgrade/).

* Windows Tools: `qvm-block` does not work

* Some icons in the Qubes Manager application might not be drawn correctly when using the Xfce4 environment in Dom0. If this bothers you, please use the KDE environment instead.

* For other known issues take a look at [our tickets](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+3.2%22+label%3Abug)

It is advised to install updates just after system installation to apply bug fixes for (some of) the above problems.

See [Qubes Downloads](/downloads/).

Installation instructions
-------------------------

See [Installation Guide](/doc/installation-guide/).
After installation, [manually upgrade to Fedora 26](/news/2018/01/06/fedora-26-upgrade/).

Upgrading
---------

### From R3.1

The easiest and safest way to upgrade to Qubes R3.2 is to install it from
scratch and use [qubes backup and restore tools][backup] for
migrating of all of the user VMs.

Users of Qubes R3.1 can also upgrade using [this
procedure][upgrade].

### From R3.0 or earlier

When upgrading from earlier versions the easiest and safest way is to install
it from scratch and use [qubes backup and restore tools][backup]
for migrating of all of the user VMs.

Alternatively you can [upgrade to R3.1 using][upgrade-r3.1] first, then follow
the instructions above. This will be time consuming process.
