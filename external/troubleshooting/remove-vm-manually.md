How to Remove VMs Manually
==========================

How to Remove a TemplateVM Manually 
-----------------------------------

Try the [normal method] before resorting to this.
All of the following commands should be executed in a dom0 terminal.

When a template is marked as 'installed by package manager', but cannot be uninstalled there, trying to uninstall manually will result in the error "ERROR: VM installed by package manager: template-vm-name". Do as follows to be able to uninstall the template:

1. Check the state of `installed_by_rpm`

       $ qvm-prefs template-vm-name

2. If `installed_by_rpm - True]`, mark the template as not installed by package manager

       $ qvm-prefs template-vm-name installed_by_rpm false

3. Re-check the state of `installed_by_rpm`

- If `installed_by_rpm - False`, remove the template like you would a regular PedOS VM:

       $ qvm-remove template-vm-name

- If `installed_by_rpm` remains `True`, reboot your computer to bring PedOS.xml in sync with PedOSd, and try again to remove the template.
