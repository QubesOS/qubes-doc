Emergency Backup Recovery without Qubes (v4)
============================================

This page describes how to perform an emergency restore of a backup created on
Qubes R4.X (which uses backup format version 4).

The Qubes backup system has been designed with emergency disaster recovery in
mind. No special Qubes-specific tools are required to access data backed up by
Qubes. In the event a Qubes system is unavailable, you can access your data on
any GNU/Linux system with the following procedure.


Required `scrypt` Utility
-------------------------

In Qubes 4.X, backups are encrypted and integrity-protected with [scrypt]. You
will need a copy of this utility in order to access your data.  Since `scrypt`
is not pre-installed on every GNU/Linux system, it is strongly recommended that
you store a copy of it with your backups. If your distribution has `scrypt`
packaged (e.g., Debian), you can install the package in the standard way using
your distribution's package manager. Otherwise, you'll need to obtain a
compiled binary (instructions below) or compile the program from source
yourself. (Don't forget to [verify signatures] first!) Note that versions of
`scrypt` up to 1.2.0 (inclusive) do not support the `-P` option for easier
scripting, which means you'll need to enter the passphrase for each file
separately, instead of using `echo ... | scrypt`.

Here are instructions for obtaining a compiled `scrypt` binary. This example
uses an RPM-based system (Fedora), but the same general procedure should work on
any GNU/Linux system.

 1. If you're not on Qubes 4.X, [get and verify the Release 4 Signing Key].
 2. If you're not on Qubes 4.X, import the Release 4 Signing Key:

        [user@restore ~]$ sudo rpm --import qubes-release-4-signing-key.asc

 3. Download the `scrypt` RPM:

        [user@restore ~]$ dnf download scrypt

    or, if that doesn't work:

        [user@restore ~]$ curl -O https://yum.qubes-os.org/r4.0/current/vm/fc28/rpm/scrypt-1.2.1-1.fc28.x86_64.rpm

 4. Verify the signature on the `scrypt` RPM:

        [user@restore ~]$ rpm -K scrypt-*.rpm 
        scrypt-*.rpm: digests signatures OK

    The message `digests signatures OK` means that both the digest (i.e., the
    output of a hash function) and PGP signature verification were successful.

 5. Install `rpmdevtools`:

        [user@restore ~]$ sudo dnf install rpmdevtools

 6. Extract the `scrypt` binary from the RPM:

        [user@restore ~]$ rpmdev-extract scrypt-*.rpm

 7. (Optional) Create an alias for the new binary:

        [user@restore ~]$ alias scrypt="scrypt-*/usr/bin/scrypt"


Emergency Recovery Instructions
-------------------------------

**Note:** In the following example, the backup file is both *encrypted* and
*compressed*.

 1. Untar the main backup file.

        [user@restore ~]$ tar -i -xvf qubes-backup-2015-06-05T123456
        backup-header
        backup-header.hmac
        qubes.xml.000.enc
        vm1/private.img.000.enc
        vm1/private.img.001.enc
        vm1/private.img.002.enc
        vm1/icon.png.000.enc
        vm1/firewall.xml.000.enc
        vm1/whitelisted-appmenus.list.000.enc
        dom0-home/dom0user.000.enc

    **Note:** Each VM in the backup file has its path listed in
    `qubes.xml.000.enc` (search for the `backup-path` property). You can
    extract only the files necessary for your VM (`vmX`) with `tar -i -xvf
    qubes-backup-2015-06-05T123456 backup-header backup-header.hmac vmX/`.

 2. Set the backup passhprase environment variable. While this isn't strictly
    required, it will be handy later and will avoid saving the passphrase in
    the shell's history.

        [user@restore ~]$ read backup_pass

 3. Verify the integrity of `backup-header`. For compatibility reasons,
    `backup-header.hmac` is an encrypted *and integrity protected*
    version of `backup-header`.

        [user@restore ~]$ set +H
        [user@restore ~]$ echo "backup-header!$backup_pass" |\
            scrypt dec -P backup-header.hmac backup-header.verified && \
            diff -qs backup-header backup-header.verified
        Files backup-header and backup-header.verified are identical

    **Note:** If this command fails, it may be that the backup was tampered
    with or is in a different format. In the latter case, look inside
    `backup-header` at the `version` field. If it contains a value other than
    `version=4`, go to the instructions for that format version:
    - [Emergency Backup Recovery without Qubes (v2)]
    - [Emergency Backup Recovery without Qubes (v3)]

 4. Read `backup-header`:

        [user@restore ~]$ cat backup-header
        version=4
        encrypted=True
        compressed=True
        compression-filter=gzip
        backup_id=20161020T123455-1234

 5. Set `backup_id` to the value in the last line of `backup-header`:

        [user@restore ~]$ backup_id=20161020T123455-1234

 6. Verify the integrity of and decrypt the `private.img` file that houses your
    data.

        [user@restore ~]$ for f_enc in vm1/private.img.???.enc; do \
            f_dec=${f_enc%.enc}; \
            echo "$backup_id!$f_dec!$backup_pass" | scrypt dec -P $f_enc $f_dec || break; \
            done

    **Note:** If this command fails, it is likely that the backup is corrupted
    or has been tampered with.

 7. Decompress and untar the decrypted `private.img` file.

        [user@restore ~]$ cat vm1/private.img.??? | gzip -d | tar -xv
        vm1/private.img

    **Note:** If your backup was compressed with a program other than `gzip`,
    you must substitute the correct compression program. This information is
    contained in `backup-header` (see step 4). For example, if you used `bzip2`,
    then you should do this:

        [user@restore vm1]$ mv private.img.dec private.img.dec.bz2
        [user@restore vm1]$ bunzip2 private.img.dec.bz2

 8. Mount `private.img` and access your data.

        [user@restore vm1]$ sudo mkdir /mnt/img
        [user@restore vm1]$ sudo mount -o loop vm1/private.img /mnt/img/
        [user@restore vm1]$ cat /mnt/img/home/user/your_data.txt
        This data has been successfully recovered!

 9. Success! If you wish to recover data from more than one VM in your backup,
    simply repeat steps 6--8 for each additional VM.

    **Note:** You may wish to store a copy of these instructions with your
    Qubes backups in the event that you fail to recall the above procedure
    while this web page is inaccessible. All Qubes documentation, including
