Client Software / Setup:

- BIOS Setup: UEFI-Boot + Secure Boot

Concept:
- the idea was to setup Qubes OS in the recent version on the 2nd SSD (HDD2) which has been inserted as replacement for the optical drive
- this would not harm the existing installation on HDD1.
- Using F12 it would be possible to choose between HDD1 (Windows) and HDD2 (Qubes OS)
- HDD1 could be encrypted via BitLocker and HDD2 could use the LUKS encryption.
