Using KDE in dom0
=================

Installation
------------

Prior to R3.2, KDE was the default desktop environment in Qubes. Beginning with
R3.2, however, [XFCE is the new default desktop environment](/doc/releases/3.2/release-notes/). Nonetheless, it is
still possible to install KDE by issuing this command in dom0:

    $ sudo qubes-dom0-update @kde-desktop-qubes

You can also change your default login manager (lightdm) to the new KDE default: sddm

 * first you need to edit the `/etc/sddm.conf` to make sure if the custom X parameter is set according to Qubes needs:

~~~
   [XDisplay]
   ServerArguments=-nolisten tcp -background none
~~~

 * disable the lightdm service:

~~~  
   $ sudo systemctl disable lightdm
~~~  

 * enable the sddm service:

~~~
    $ sudo systemctl enable sddm
~~~

 * reboot

If you encounter performance issues with KDE, try switching back to LightDM.

Window Management
-----------------

You can set each window's position and size like this:

~~~
Right click title bar --> More actions --> Special window settings...

  Window matching tab
    Window class (application): Exact Match: <vm_name>
    Window title: Substring Match: <partial or full program name>

  Size & Position tab
    [x] Position: Apply Initially: x,y
    [x] Size: Apply Initially: x,y
~~~

You can also use `kstart` to control virtual desktop placement like this:

~~~
  kstart --desktop 3 --windowclass <vm_name> -q --tray -a <vm_name> '<run_program_command>'
~~~

(Replace "3" with whichever virtual desktop you want the window to be
on.)

This can be useful for creating a simple shell script which will set up your
workspace the way you like.
