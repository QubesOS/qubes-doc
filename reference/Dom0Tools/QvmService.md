Date

SYNOPSIS
--------

qvm-service [-l] \<vmname\>
qvm-service [-e|-d|-D] \<vmname\> \<service\>

OPTIONS
-------

-h, --help  
Show this help message and exit

-l, --list  
List services (default action)

-e, --enable  
Enable service

-d, --disable  
Disable service

-D, --default  
Reset service to its default state (remove from the list). Default state means "lets VM choose" and can depend on VM type (NetVM, AppVM etc).

SUPPORTED SERVICES
------------------

This list can be incomplete as VM can implement any additional service without knowlege of qubes-core code.

meminfo-writer  
Default: enabled everywhere excluding NetVM

This service reports VM memory usage to dom0, which effectively enables dynamic memory management for the VM.

*Note:* this service is enforced to be set by dom0 code. If you try to remove it (reset to defult state), will be recreated with the rule: enabled if VM have no PCI devices assigned, otherwise disabled.

qubes-dvm  
Default: disabled

Used internally when creating DispVM savefile.

qubes-firewall  
Default: enabled only in ProxyVM

Dynamic firewall manager, based on settings in dom0 (qvm-firewall, firewall tab in qubes-manager). This service is not supported in netvms.

qubes-network  
Default: enabled only in NetVM and ProxyVM

Expose network for other VMs. This includes enabling network forwarding, MASQUERADE, DNS redirection and basic firewall.

qubes-netwatcher  
Default: enabled only in ProxyVM

Monitor IP change notification from NetVM. When received, reload qubes-firewall service (to force DNS resolution). This service makes sense only with qubes-firewall enabled.

qubes-update-check  
Default: enabled

Notify dom0 about updates available for this VM. This is shown in qubes-manager as 'update-pending' flag.

cups  
Default: enabled only in AppVM

Enable CUPS service. The user can disable cups in VM which do not need printing to speed up booting.

cron  
Default: disabled

Enable CRON service.

network-manager  
Default: enabled in NetVM

Enable NetworkManager. Only VM with direct access to network device needs this service, but can be useful in ProxyVM to ease VPN setup.

ntpd  
Default: disabled

Enable NTPD service. By default Qubes calls ntpdate every 6 minutes in selected VM (aka ClockVM), then propagate the result using qrexec calls. Enabling ntpd *do not* disable this behaviour.

qubes-yum-proxy  
Deprecated name for qubes-updates-proxy.

qubes-updates-proxy  
Default: enabled in NetVM

Provide proxy service, which allow access only to yum repos. Filtering is done based on URLs, so it shouldn't be used as leak control (pretty easy to bypass), but is enough to prevent some erroneous user actions.

yum-proxy-setup  
Deprecated name for updates-proxy-setup.

updates-proxy-setup  
Default: enabled in AppVM (also in templates)

Setup yum at startup to use qubes-yum-proxy service.

*Note:* this service is automatically enabled when you allow VM to access yum proxy (in firewall settings) and disabled when you deny access to yum proxy.

disable-default-route  
Default: disabled

Disables the default route for networking. Enabling this service will prevent the creation of the default route, but the VM will still be able to reach it's direct neighbors. The functionality is implemented in /usr/lib/qubes/setup-ip.

disable-dns-server  
Default: disabled

Enabling this service will result in an empty /etc/resolv.conf. The functionality is implemented in /usr/lib/qubes/setup-ip.
