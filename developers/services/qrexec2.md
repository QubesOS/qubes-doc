# Command execution in VMs #

(*This page is about qrexec v2. For qrexec v3, see
[here](/doc/qrexec3/).*)

Qubes **qrexec** is a framework for implementing inter-VM (incl. Dom0-VM)
services. It offers a mechanism to start programs in VMs, redirect their
stdin/stdout, and a policy framework to control this all.


## Qrexec basics ##

During each domain creation a process named `qrexec-daemon` is started in
dom0, and a process named `qrexec-agent` is started in the VM. They are
connected over `vchan` channel.

Typically, the first thing that a `qrexec-client` instance does is to send
a request to `qrexec-agent` to start a process in the VM. From then on,
the stdin/stdout/stderr from this remote process will be passed to the
`qrexec-client` process.

E.g., to start a primitive shell in a VM type the following in Dom0 console:

    [user@dom0 ~]$ /usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-client -d <vm name> user:bash

The string before first semicolon specifies what user to run the command as.

Adding `-e` on the `qrexec-client` command line results in mere command
execution (no data passing), and `qrexec-client` exits immediately after
sending the execution request.

There is also the `-l <local program>` flag, which directs `qrexec-client`
to pass stdin/stdout of the remote program not to its stdin/stdout, but to
the (spawned for this purpose) `<local program>`.

The `qvm-run` command is heavily based on `qrexec-client`. It also takes care
of additional activities (e.g., starting the domain, if it is not up yet, and
starting the GUI daemon). Thus, it is usually more convenient to use `qvm-run`.

There can be almost arbitrary number of `qrexec-client` processes for a domain
(i.e., `qrexec-client` processes connected to the same `qrexec-daemon`);
their data is multiplexed independently.

There is a similar command line utility available inside Linux AppVMs (note
the `-vm` suffix): `qrexec-client-vm` that will be described in subsequent
sections.


## Qubes RPC services ##

Apart from simple Dom0-\>VM command executions, as discussed above, it is
also useful to have more advanced infrastructure for controlled inter-VM
RPC/services. This might be used for simple things like inter-VM file
copy operations, as well as more complex tasks like starting a DispVM,
and requesting it to do certain operations on a handed file(s).

Instead of implementing complex RPC-like mechanisms for inter-VM communication,
Qubes takes a much simpler and pragmatic approach and aims to only provide
simple *pipes* between the VMs, plus ability to request *pre-defined* programs
(servers) to be started on the other end of such pipes, and a centralized
policy (enforced by the `qrexec-policy` process running in dom0) which says
which VMs can request what services from what VMs.

Thanks to the framework and automatic stdin/stdout redirection, RPC programs
are very simple; both the client and server just use their stdin/stdout to pass
data. The framework does all the inner work to connect these file descriptors
to each other via `qrexec-daemon` and `qrexec-agent`. Additionally, DispVMs
are tightly integrated; RPC to a DispVM is a simple matter of using a magic
`$dispvm` keyword as the target VM name.

All services in Qubes are identified by a single string, which by convention
takes a form of `qubes.ServiceName`. Each VM can provide handlers for each of
the known services by providing a file in `/etc/qubes-rpc/` directory with
the same name as the service it is supposed to handle. This file will then
be executed by the qrexec service, if the dom0 policy allowed the service to
be requested (see below). Typically, the files in `/etc/qubes-rpc/` contain
just one line, which is a path to the specific binary that acts as a server
for the incoming request, however they might also be the actual executable
themselves. Qrexec framework is careful about connecting the stdin/stdout
of the server process with the corresponding stdin/stdout of the requesting
process in the requesting VM (see example Hello World service described below).


## Qubes RPC administration ##

Besides each VM needing to provide explicit programs to serve each supported
service, the inter-VM service RPC is also governed by a central policy in Dom0.

In dom0, there is a bunch of files in `/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/` directory,
whose names describe the available RPC actions; their content is the RPC
access policy database. Some example of the default services in Qubes are:

    qubes.Filecopy
    qubes.OpenInVM
    qubes.ReceiveUpdates
    qubes.SyncAppMenus
    qubes.VMShell
    qubes.ClipboardPaste
    qubes.Gpg
    qubes.NotifyUpdates
    qubes.PdfConvert

These files contain lines with the following format:

    srcvm destvm (allow|deny|ask)[,user=user_to_run_as][,target=VM_to_redirect_to]

You can specify `srcvm` and `destvm` by name, or by one of `$anyvm`,
`$dispvm`, `dom0` reserved keywords (note string `dom0` does not match the
`$anyvm` pattern; all other names do). Only `$anyvm` keyword makes sense
in the `srcvm` field (service calls from dom0 are currently always allowed,
`$dispvm` means "new VM created for this particular request" - so it is never
a source of request). Currently, there is no way to specify source VM by type,
but this is planned for Qubes R3.

Whenever a RPC request for service named "XYZ" is received, the first line
in `/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/XYZ` that matches the actual `srcvm`/`destvm` is
consulted to determine whether to allow RPC, what user account the program
should run in target VM under, and what VM to redirect the execution to. If
the policy file does not exits, user is prompted to create one *manually*;
if still there is no policy file after prompting, the action is denied.

On the target VM, the `/etc/qubes-rpc/XYZ` must exist, containing the file
name of the program that will be invoked.


### Requesting VM-VM (and VM-Dom0) services execution ###

In a src VM, one should invoke the qrexec client via the following command:

    /usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-client-vm <target vm name> <service name> <local program path> [local program arguments]

Note that only stdin/stdout is passed between RPC server and client --
notably, no cmdline argument are passed.

The source VM name can be accessed in the server process via
`QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN` environment variable. (Note the source VM has *no*
control over the name provided in this variable--the name of the VM is
provided by dom0, and so is trusted.)

By default, stderr of client and server is logged to respective
`/var/log/qubes/qrexec.XID` files, in each of the VM.

Be very careful when coding and adding a new RPC service! Any vulnerability
in a RPC server can be fatal to security of the target VM!

If requesting VM-VM (and VM-Dom0) services execution *without cmdline helper*,
connect directly to `/var/run/qubes/qrexec-agent-fdpass` socket as described
[below](#all-the-pieces-together-at-work).

### Revoking "Yes to All" authorization ###

Qubes RPC policy supports an "ask" action, that will prompt the user whether
a given RPC call should be allowed. It is set as default for services such
as inter-VM file copy. A prompt window launches in dom0, that gives the user
option to click "Yes to All", which allows the action and adds a new entry
to the policy file, which will unconditionally allow further calls for given
(service, srcVM, dstVM) tuple.

In order to remove such authorization, issue this command from a Dom0 terminal
(example below for `qubes.Filecopy` service):

    sudo nano /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.Filecopy

and then remove any line(s) ending in "allow" (before the first `##` comment)
which are the "Yes to All" results.

A user might also want to set their own policies in this section. This may
mostly serve to prevent the user from mistakenly copying files or text from
a trusted to untrusted domain, or vice-versa.


### Qubes RPC "Hello World" service ###

We will show the necessary files to create a simple RPC call that adds two
integers on the target VM and returns back the result to the invoking VM.

 * Client code on source VM (`/usr/bin/our_test_add_client`)

        #!/bin/sh
        echo $1 $2    # pass data to rpc server
        exec cat >&$SAVED_FD_1 # print result to the original stdout, not to the other rpc endpoint

 * Server code on target VM (`/usr/bin/our_test_add_server`)

        #!/bin/sh
        read arg1 arg2 # read from stdin, which is received from the rpc client
        echo $(($arg1+$arg2)) # print to stdout - so, pass to the rpc client

 * Policy file in dom0 (`/etc/qubes-rpc/policy/test.Add`)

        $anyvm $anyvm ask

 * Server path definition on target VM (`/etc/qubes-rpc/test.Add`)

        /usr/bin/our_test_add_server

 * To test this service, run the following in the source VM:

        /usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-client-vm <target VM> test.Add /usr/bin/our_test_add_client 1 2

and we should get "3" as answer, provided dom0 policy allows the call to pass
through, which would happen after we click "Yes" in the popup that should
appear after the invocation of this command. If we changed the policy from
"ask" to "allow", then no popup should be presented, and the call will always
be allowed.

**Note:** For a real world example of writing a qrexec service, see this
[blog post](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013/02/converting-untrusted-pdfs-into-trusted.html).

### More high-level RPCs? ###

As previously noted, Qubes aims to provide mechanisms that are very simple
and thus with very small attack surface. This is the reason why the inter-VM
RPC framework is very primitive and doesn't include any serialization or
other function arguments passing, etc. We should remember, however, that
users/app developers are always free to run more high-level RPC protocols on
top of qrexec. Care should be taken, however, to consider potential attack
surfaces that are exposed to untrusted or less trusted VMs in that case.


# Qubes RPC internals #

(*This is about the implementation of qrexec v2. For the implementation of
qrexec v3, see [here](/doc/qrexec3/#qubes-rpc-internals). Note that the user
API in v3 is backward compatible: qrexec apps written for Qubes R2 should
run without modification on Qubes R3.*)


## Dom0 tools implementation ##

Players:

 * `/usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-daemon`: started by mgmt stack (qubes.py) when a
 VM is started.
 * `/usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-policy`: internal program used to evaluate the
 policy file and making the 2nd half of the connection.
 * `/usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-client`: raw command line tool that talks to the
 daemon via unix socket (`/var/run/qubes/qrexec.XID`)

**Note:** None of the above tools are designed to be used by users.


## Linux VMs implementation ##

Players:

 * `/usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-agent`: started by VM bootup scripts, a daemon.
 * `/usr/lib/qubes/qubes-rpc-multiplexer`: executes the actual service program,
 as specified in VM's `/etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.XYZ`.
 * `/usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-client-vm`: raw command line tool that talks to
 the agent.

**Note:** None of the above tools are designed to be used by
users. `qrexec-client-vm` is designed to be wrapped up by Qubes apps.


## Windows VMs implementation ##

`%QUBES_DIR%` is the installation path (`c:\Program Files\Invisible Things
Lab\Qubes OS Windows Tools` by default).

 * `%QUBES_DIR%\bin\qrexec-agent.exe`: runs as a system service. Responsible
 both for raw command execution and interpreting RPC service requests.
 * `%QUBES_DIR%\qubes-rpc`: directory with `qubes.XYZ` files that contain
 commands for executing RPC services. Binaries for the services are contained
 in `%QUBES_DIR%\qubes-rpc-services`.
 * `%QUBES_DIR%\bin\qrexec-client-vm`: raw command line tool that talks to
 the agent.

**Note:** None of the above tools are designed to be used by
users. `qrexec-client-vm` is designed to be wrapped up by Qubes apps.


## All the pieces together at work ##

**Note:** This section is not needed to use qrexec for writing Qubes
apps. Also note the [qrexec framework implemention in Qubes R3](/doc/qrexec3/)
significantly differs from what is described in this section.

The VM-VM channels in Qubes R2 are made via "gluing" two VM-Dom0 and Dom0-VM
vchan connections:

![qrexec2-internals.png](/attachment/wiki/Qrexec2Implementation/qrexec2-internals.png)

Note that Dom0 never examines the actual data flowing in neither of the two
vchan connections.

When a user in a source VM executes `qrexec-client-vm` utility, the following
steps are taken:

 * `qrexec-client-vm` connects to `qrexec-agent`'s
 `/var/run/qubes/qrexec-agent-fdpass` unix socket 3 times. Reads 4 bytes from
 each of them, which is the fd number of the accepted socket in agent. These
 3 integers, in text, concatenated, form "connection identifier" (CID)
 * `qrexec-client-vm` writes to `/var/run/qubes/qrexec-agent` fifo a blob,
 consisting of target vmname, rpc action, and CID
 * `qrexec-client-vm` executes the rpc client, passing the above mentioned
 unix sockets as process stdin/stdout, and optionally stderr (if the
 `PASS_LOCAL_STDERR` env variable is set)
 * `qrexec-agent` passes the blob to `qrexec-daemon`, via
 `MSG_AGENT_TO_SERVER_TRIGGER_CONNECT_EXISTING` message over vchan
 * `qrexec-daemon` executes `qrexec-policy`, passing source vmname, target
 vmname, rpc action, and CID as cmdline arguments
 * `qrexec-policy` evaluates the policy file. If successful, creates a pair of
 `qrexec-client` processes, whose stdin/stdout are cross-connected.
   * The first `qrexec-client` connects to the src VM, using the `-c ClientID`
   parameter, which results in not creating a new process, but connecting to
   the existing process file descriptors (these are the fds of unix socket
   created in step 1).
   * The second `qrexec-client` connects to the target VM, and executes
   `qubes-rpc-multiplexer` command there with the rpc action as the cmdline
   argument. Finally, `qubes-rpc-multiplexer` executes the correct rpc server
   on the target.
 * In the above step, if the target VM is `$dispvm`, the DispVM is created
 via the `qfile-daemon-dvm` program. The latter waits for the `qrexec-client`
 process to exit, and then destroys the DispVM.
