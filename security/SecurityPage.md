Reporting Security Issues in Qubes OS
=====================================

If you believe you have found a security issue affecting Qubes OS, either directly or indirectly (e.g. the issue affects Xen in a configuration that is used in Qubes OS), then we would be more than happy to hear from you!

We promise to treat any reported issue seriously and, if the investigation confirms it affects Qubes, to patch it within a reasonable time, and also to release a public Security Bulletin that describes the issue, discusses potential impact of the vulnerability, references applicable patches or workarounds, and also credits the discoverer.

The list of all Qubes Security Advisories published so far can be found [here](/doc/SecurityBulletins/).
