Qubes Security Pack
===================

The **Qubes Security Pack (QSP)** is a Git repository which contains:

 * [Qubes Security Bulletins (QSBs)](/en/doc/security-bulletins/)
 * [Qubes PGP keys](https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/)
 * [Qubes warrant canaries](https://canarywatch.org/qubesOS/)
 * Security-related information and announcements (e.g., key revocations)

The official location of the QSP is:

`https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack`
[(link)](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack)


History and Rationale
---------------------

On 2013-01-05, Joanna Rutkowska announced the QSP and explained its rationale in
an [email](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/qubes-devel/twkOEaMLtNI/lZyGx6_jFCEJ)
to the Qubes mailing lists:

    Hello,
    
    A new Qubes Security Bulletin has been just released and is available here:
    
    https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/QSBs/qsb-013-2015.txt
    
    As per the previous discussions about recent problems with verifying
    digital signatures on messages sent to Google Groups (thanks to
    automatic footer addition by Google), we have decided to change the way
    we publish Qubes Security Bulletins, as well as other security-related
    info pertinent to the Qubes Project.
    
    Starting today, we will be maintain a Git repository -- "Qubes Security
    Pack" -- which will contain all the QSBs released so far, all the keys,
    warrant canaries [1], and potentially some additional info or
    announcements (e.g. key revocations). The whole repo can be found here:
    
    https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack
    
    Note that all the keys distributed there should be signed by Qubes
    Master Key. The Master Key is also attached in the repo, but should
    really be obtained/verified using a different channel.
    
    Additionally, most of the files are signed by core Qubes
    developers (currently by Marek and myself) via detached signatures as
    well as git tag signatures.
    
    The are several advantages of using Git to distribute all these information:
    
    1) Git repo is a collection of files, some of which can be detached GPG
    signatures for other files and we can ensure all these files are
    distributed together.
    
    2) Git makes it easy for people to clone and redistribute these
    collection of files, as well as to easily host them and view on the Web.
    
    3) Git provides for signed tags mechanisms which is another mean we
    utilize to ensure integrity of the distributed files.
    
    A few words about the Warrant Canary which we've just introduced today,
    and which can be seen here:
    
    https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/canaries/canary-001-2015.txt
    
    Even though we're not providing any kind of services (such as e.g. email
    hosting), that could be searched or tapped by authorities, there are
    other possibilities that worry us [2], in the light of various recent
    law "developments", such as those that might be coercing people to hand
    over their private keys to authorities.
    
    Until we fully decentralize the root of trust for Qubes, something that
    requires the move to deterministic builds [3], and so won't happen
    very soon, the possibility of having to disclose any of the Qubes
    signing keys to anybody might have pretty serious consequences for those
    who decided to entrust Qubes with anything serious. And we would like to
    somehow minimize these consequences with this canary thing.
    
    Additionally the canary is a nice way of ensuring "freshness" of our
    messaging to the community.
    
    Of course the canary doesn't solve all the problems. E.g. if my signing
    keys were somehow stolen without our knowledge, it wouldn't help.
    Neither it could help in case me being or becoming a miscreant. And
    probably it doesn't address many other potential problems, which could
    only be solved one day with a multi-signature scheme. But anyway, until
    that time, this is the best we can do, I think.
    
    And congrats to Jann for the very interesting clipboard attack (even
    though mostly theoretical, still very cool)!
    
    Thanks,
    joanna.

How to Obtain, Verify, and Read
-------------------------------

The following example demonstrates one method of obtaining the QSP, verifying
its contents, and reading them.

 1. Clone the QSP repo.

        [user@qubes ~]$ git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack.git
        Cloning into 'qubes-secpack'...
        remote: Counting objects: 195, done.
        remote: Total 195 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
        Receiving objects: 100% (195/195), 130.94 KiB | 207.00 KiB/s, done.
        Resolving deltas: 100% (47/47), done.
        Checking connectivity... done.

 2. Import the included PGP keys.

        [user@qubes ~]$ gpg --import qubes-secpack/keys/*/*

        gpg> q

    **Important!**
   
    In order to verify the authenticity of the Qubes Master Signing Key prior to
    trusting it, you should obtain the Qubes Master Signing Key fingerprint from
    a trustworthy source (ideally, multiple sources) *other than* this website
    and visually compare it (them) to the fingerprint displayed in the preceding
    step, ensuring they match. You can read more about digital signatures and
    key verification [here](/en/doc/verifying-signatures/).

 4. Verify and read the canaries.

        [user@qubes ~]$ cd qubes-secpack/canaries/                                     
        [user@qubes canaries]$ gpg --verify canary-001-2015.txt.sig.joanna canary-001-2015.txt
        gpg: Signature made Mon Jan  5 20:21:40 2015 UTC using RSA key ID 92C7B3DC
        gpg: Good signature from "Joanna Rutkowska (Qubes Security Pack Signing Key) <joanna@invisiblethingslab.com>"

                                         [...]

 5. Verify and read the QSBs.

        [user@qubes canaries]$ cd ../QSBs/
        [user@qubes QSBs]$ gpg --verify qsb-013-2015.txt.sig.joanna qsb-013-2015.txt
        gpg: Signature made Mon Jan  5 21:22:14 2015 UTC using RSA key ID 92C7B3DC
        gpg: Good signature from "Joanna Rutkowska (Qubes Security Pack Signing Key) <joanna@invisiblethingslab.com>"
        [user@qubes QSBs]$ gpg --verify qsb-013-2015.txt.sig.marmarek qsb-013-2015.txt
        gpg: Signature made Mon Jan  5 21:38:11 2015 UTC using RSA key ID 1830E06A
        gpg: Good signature from "Marek Marczykowski-G�recki (Qubes security pack) <marmarek@invisiblethingslab.com>"
        [user@qubes QSBs]$ cat qsb-013-2015.txt
