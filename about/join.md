Join the Qubes OS Team!
=======================

The Qubes OS Project is seeking individuals for the positions listed
below. If you're interested in any of these positions, please send an email to
[Marek Marczykowski-GÃ³recki](mailto:marmarek@invisiblethingslab.com).

Besides the positions below, there are many different ways you can [contribute to the Qubes OS project](/doc/contributing/). 

Stable release manager
----------------------

### General tasks ###

 * Deciding what will be fixed in each stable release and what will be fixed
   only in new major releases
 * Backporting fixes to stable releases (and requesting core dev input when it
   isn't trivial)
 * Releasing packages for stable release (deciding when the package should be
   released to the `current-testing` repository and when it should be moved to
   the `current` repository)

As this position involves great trust and may have major impact on project
security, we'd like for the candidate to be already known and active in Qubes
OS community.
