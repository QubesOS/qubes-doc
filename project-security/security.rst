Reporting security issues in Qubes OS
-------------------------------------


.. warning::
      Please note: The Qubes security team email address is intended for
      responsible disclosure by security researchers and others who
      discover legitimate security vulnerabilities. It is not intended for
      everyone who suspects they’ve been hacked. Please do not attempt to
      contact the Qubes security team unless you can demonstrate an actual
      security vulnerability or unless the team will be able to take
      reasonable steps to verify your claims.


If you’ve discovered a security issue affecting Qubes OS, either
directly or indirectly (e.g., the issue affects Xen in a configuration
that is used in Qubes OS), then we would be more than happy to hear from
you! We promise to take all reported issues seriously. If our
investigation confirms that an issue affects Qubes, we will patch it
within a reasonable time and release a public `Qubes security bulletin (QSB) <https://www.qubes-os.org/security/qsb/>`__ that describes the issue, discusses the
potential impact of the vulnerability, references applicable patches or
workarounds, and credits the discoverer. Please use the `Qubes security team PGP key <https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-os-security-team-key.asc>`__
to encrypt your email to this address:

.. code:: bash

      security at qubes-os dot org



This key is signed by the `Qubes Master Signing Key <https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/qubes-master-signing-key.asc>`__.
Please see :doc:`verifying signatures </project-security/verifying-signatures>`
for information about how to authenticate these keys.

Security updates

Qubes security updates are obtained by :doc:`updating Qubes OS </user/how-to-guides/how-to-update>`.

Qubes security team
-------------------


The **Qubes security team (QST)** is the subset of the `core team <https://www.qubes-os.org/team/#core-team>`__ that is responsible for ensuring the security
of Qubes OS and the Qubes OS Project. In particular, the QST is
responsible for:

- Responding to `reported security issues <#reporting-security-issues-in-qubes-os>`__

- Evaluating whether `XSAs <https://www.qubes-os.org/security/xsa/>`__ affect the security of
  Qubes OS

- Writing, applying, and/or distributing security patches to fix
  vulnerabilities in Qubes OS

- Writing, signing, and publishing `Qubes security bulletins (QSBs) <https://www.qubes-os.org/security/qsb/>`__

- Writing, signing, and publishing `Qubes canaries <https://www.qubes-os.org/security/canary/>`__

- Generating, safeguarding, and using the project’s `PGP keys <https://keys.qubes-os.org/keys/>`__



As a security-oriented operating system, the QST is fundamentally
important to Qubes, and every Qubes user implicitly trusts the members
of the QST by virtue of the actions listed above.
