---

A **Qubes security bulletin (QSB)** is a security announcement issued by the
[Qubes security team](/security/#qubes-security-team) through the [Qubes
security pack](/security/pack/). A QSB typically provides a summary and impact
analysis of one or more recently-discovered software vulnerabilities, including
details about patching to address them. For Xen Security Advisories (XSAs), see
the [XSA tracker](/security/xsa/).
