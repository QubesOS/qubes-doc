Install Whonix in Qubes
=======================

Installing Whonix in Qubes is simple and only requires a few simple steps.

### First Time Users

Using privacy and anonymization tools like Whonix is not a magical solution that instantly makes you anonymous online. Please consider:

* Do you know what metadata or a man-in-the-middle attack is?
* Do you think nobody can eavesdrop on your communications because you are using Tor?
* Do you know how Whonix works?

If you answered no, have a look at the [about](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/About), [warning](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Warning) and [do not](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/DoNot) pages (on the Whonix website) to make sure Whonix is the right tool for you and you understand  it's limitations.

### Install Templates

Launch the `dom0` terminal `Konsole` from your Qubes App Launcher. Then enter the following command to install the Whonix-Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs.

~~~
sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-templates-community qubes-template-whonix-gw qubes-template-whonix-ws
~~~

Download will take a while and there will be no progress indicator.

After doing this, you should see two new TemplateVMs in the VM Manager called `whonix-gw` and `whonix-ws`

### Enabling AppArmor

This is an optional security enhancement (for testers-only). If youâ€™re technical & interested, see [Enabling AppArmor](/doc/privacy/customizing-whonix/).

### Configuring Whonix VMs

Create a **Whonix-Gateway** ProxyVM by clicking on `Create a New VM` and select `whonix-gw` as the template and select ProxyVM as the type.

Create a **Whonix-Workstation** AppVM by clicking on `Create a New VM` and select `whonix-ws` as the template and select AppVM (should be default) as the type.

Configure the **Whonix-Gateway TemplateVM** to use the `sys-whonix` ProxyVM that you just created.

Great. You should be all done installing Whonix into Qubes. Use these two TemplateVMs and the ProxyVM you just added, like you would for any other VMs.

### Running Applications

To start an application in the **Whonix-Workstation AppVM** that you created, launch it like any other- open the `Qubes App Launcher` and then select an app such as `Privacy Browser` which will then launch the Tor Browser
