Whonix for Privacy & Anonymity
==============================

To improve your privacy and anonymity on the internet, you can install the
Whonix Template on your Qubes machine.

[Whonix](https://www.whonix.org) is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org)
and [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) and utilizes two VMs, a **"gateway"** and
a **"workstation"**. Qubes security architecture makes use of Whonix's isolation
by using the gateway as a ProxyVM to route all network traffic through Tor,
while the workstation is used for making AppVMs.

Whonix in Qubes replaces the deprecated [TorVM](/doc/torvm) service used in earlier
versions of Qubes.
