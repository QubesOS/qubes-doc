Security design goals
=====================


Qubes OS implements a security-by-isolation (or
security-by-compartmentalization) approach by providing the ability to
easily create many security domains. These domains are implemented as
lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) running under the Xen hypervisor.
Qubes’ main objective is to provide strong isolation between these
domains, so that even if an attacker compromises one of the domains, the
others are still safe. Qubes, however, does not attempt to provide any
security isolation for applications running within the same domain. For
example, a buggy web browser running in a Qubes domain could still be
compromised just as easily as on a regular Linux distribution. The
difference that Qubes makes is that now the attacker doesn’t have access
to all the software running in the other domains.

Qubes also provides features that make it easy and convenient to run
these multiple domains, such as seamless GUI integration into one common
desktop, secure clipboard copy and paste between domains, secure file
transfer between domains, disposable VMs, and much more. Qubes also
provides an advanced networking infrastructure that allows for the
creation of multiple network VMs which isolate all the world-facing
networking stacks and proxy VMs which can be used for advanced VPN
configurations and tunneling over untrusted connections.
