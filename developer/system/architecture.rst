============
Architecture
============


Qubes implements a security-by-compartmentalization approach. To do
this, Qubes utilizes virtualization technology in order to isolate
various programs from each other and even to sandbox many system-level
components, such as networking and storage subsystems, so that the
compromise of any of these programs or components does not affect the
integrity of the rest of the system.

Qubes lets the user define many secure compartments known as
:ref:`qubes <user/reference/glossary:qube>`, which are implemented as lightweight
:ref:`virtual machines (VMs) <user/reference/glossary:vm>`. For example, the user
can have “personal,” “work,” “shopping,” “bank,” and “random” app qubes
and can use the applications within those qubes just as if they were
executing on the local machine. At the same time, however, these
applications are well isolated from each other. Qubes also supports
secure copy-and-paste and file sharing between qubes, of course.

Key architecture features
-------------------------


- Based on a secure bare-metal hypervisor (Xen)

- Networking code sand-boxed in an unprivileged VM (using IOMMU/VT-d)

- USB stacks and drivers sand-boxed in an unprivileged VM (currently
  experimental feature)

- No networking code in the privileged domain (dom0)

- All user applications run in “app qubes,” lightweight VMs based on
  Linux

- Centralized updates of all app qubes based on the same template

- Qubes GUI virtualization presents applications as if they were
  running locally

- Qubes GUI provides isolation between apps sharing the same desktop

- Secure system boot based (optional)

Qubes Core Stack
----------------


Qubes Core Stack is, as the name implies, the core component of Qubes
OS. It’s the glue that connects all the other components together, and
which allows users and admins to interact with and configure the system.
The other components of the Qubes system include:

- VM-located core agents (implementing e.g. qrexec endpoints used by
  various Qubes services)

- VM-customizations (making the VMs lightweight and working well with
  seamless GUI virtualization)

- Qubes GUI virtualization (the protocol, VM-located agents, and
  daemons located in the GUI domain which, for now, happens to be the
  same as dom0),

- GUI domain customizations (Desktop Environment customizations,
  decoration coloring plugin, etc)

- The admin qube distribution (various customizations, special
  services, such as for receiving and verifying updates, in the future:
  custom distro)

- The Xen hypervisor (with a bunch of customization patches, occasional
  hardening) or - in the future - some other virtualising or
  containerizing software or technology

- Multiple “Qubes Apps” (various services built on top of Qubes qrexec
  infrastructure, such as: trusted PDF and Image converters, Split GPG,
  safe USB proxies for HID devices, USB proxy for offering USB devices
  (exposed via qvm-usb), Yubikey support, USB Armory support, etc)

- Various ready-to-use templates (e.g. Debian-, Whonix-based), which
  are used to create actual VMs, i.e. provide the root filesystem to
  the VMs

- Salt Stack integration



And all these components are “glued together” by the Qubes Core Stack.

This diagram illustrates the location of all these components in the
overall system architecture. Unlike the other Qubes architecture diagram
above, this one takes an app-qube-centric approach.
