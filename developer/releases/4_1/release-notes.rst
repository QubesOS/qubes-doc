Qubes OS 4.1 release notes
==========================


New features and improvements since Qubes 4.0
---------------------------------------------


- Optional qubes-remote-support package now available from repositories
  (strictly opt-in, no package installed by default; no new ports or
  network connections open by default; requires explicit connection
  initiation by the user, then requires sharing a code word with the
  remote party before a connection can be established; see
  `#6364 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/6364>`__ for
  more information)

- Qubes firewall reworked to be more defensive (see
  `#5540 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/5540>`__ for
  details)

  details)

- Experimental support for audio server running outside of dom0 (“Audio
  domain”)
