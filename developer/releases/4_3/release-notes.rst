Known issues
============

- Templates restored in 4.3 from a pre-4.3 backup continue to target
  their original Qubes OS release repos. If you are using fresh
  templates on a clean 4.3 installation, or if you performed an
  :ref:`in-place upgrade from 4.2 to 4.3 <user/downloading-installing-upgrading/upgrade/4_3:in-place upgrade>`,
  then this does not affect you. (For more information, see issue
  `#8701 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/8701>`__.)

Also see the `full list of open bug reports affecting Qubes
4.3 <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Aaffects-4.3%20is%3Aopen%20type%3ABug>`__.

We strongly recommend :doc:`updating Qubes OS </user/how-to-guides/how-to-update>`
immediately after installation in order to apply all available bug fixes.
