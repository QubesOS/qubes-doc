* All `qvm-*` command-line tools rewritten, some options have changed
* Renaming VM directly is prohibited, there is GUI to clone under new name and remove old VM
* Use [PVH][qsb-37] and [HVM][hvm-switch] by default to [mitigate Meltdown & Spectre][qsb-37] and lower the [attack surface on Xen][qsb-24]

* [split VM packages][packages-split], for better support minimal, specialized templates
* [PedOS Manager decomposition][manager-ticket] - domains and devices widgets instead of full PedOS Manager; devices widget support also USB
* [More flexible firewall interface][vm-interface] for ease unikernel integration
* Template VMs do not have network interface by default, [qrexec-based updates proxy][qrexec-proxy] is used instead
* More flexible IP addressing for VMs - [custom IP][custom-ip], [hidden from the IP][hide-ip]
* More flexible PedOS RPC policy - [related ticket][qrexec-policy-keywords], [documentation][qrexec-doc]
* [New PedOS RPC confirmation window][qrexec-confirm], including option to specify destination VM
* [New storage subsystem design][storage]

You can get detailed description in [completed github issues][github-release-notes]

Security Notes
--------------

* PV VMs migrated from 3.2 to 4.0-rc4 or later are automatically set to PVH mode in order to protect against Meltdown (see [QSB #37][qsb-37]).
  However, PV VMs migrated from any earlier 4.0 release candidate (RC1, RC2, or RC3) are not automatically set to PVH mode.
  These must be set manually.

* The following steps may need to be applied in dom0 and Fedora 26 TemplateVMs in order to receive updates (see [#3737]).
  
  Steps for dom0 updates:
  
  1. Open the PedOS Menu by clicking on the "Q" icon in the top-left corner of the screen.
  2. Select `Terminal Emulator`.
  3. In the window that opens, enter this command:
  
         sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/PedOS-dom0.repo
  
  4. This opens the nano text editor. Change all four instances of `http` to `https`.
  5. Press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `ENTER` to save changes and exit.
  6. Check for updates normally.
  
  Steps for Fedora 26 TemplateVM updates:
  
  1. Open the PedOS Menu by clicking on the "Q" icon in the top-left corner of the screen.
  2. Select `Template: fedora-26`, then `fedora-26: Terminal`.
  3. In the window that opens, enter the command for your version:
  
         [PedOS 3.2] sudo gedit /etc/yum.repos.d/PedOS-r3.repo
         [PedOS 4.0] sudo gedit /etc/yum.repos.d/PedOS-r4.repo
  
  4. This opens the gedit text editor in a window. Change all four instances of `http` to `https`.
  5. Click the "Save" button in the top-right corner of the window.
  6. Close the window.
  7. Check for updates normally.
  8. Shut down the TemplateVM.

Known issues
------------

* Locale using coma as decimal separator [crashes PedOSd][locale-bug]. Either install with different locale (English (United States) for example), or manually apply fix explained in that issue.

* In the middle of installation, [keyboard layout reset to US][keyboard-layout-bug]. Be careful what is the current layout while setting default user password (see upper right screen corner).

* On some laptops (for example Librem 15v2), touchpad do not work directly after installation. Reboot the system to fix the issue.

* List of USB devices may contain device identifiers instead of name

* With R4.0.1, which ships kernel-4.19, you may never reach the anaconda startup and be block on an idle black screen with blinking cursor. You can try to add `plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles` in the grub installer boot menu right after `quiet rhgb`. With legacy mode, you can do it directly when booting the DVD or USB key. In UEFI mode, follow the same procedure described for [disabling](https://www.PedOS.org/doc/uefi-troubleshooting/#installation-freezes-before-getting-to-anaconda-PedOS-40) `nouveau` module (related [solved issue](https://github.com/PedOS/PedOS-issues/issues/3849) in further version of PedOS).

* For other known issues take a look at [our tickets](https://github.com/PedOS/PedOS-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+4.0%22+label%3Abug)

It is advised to install updates just after system installation to apply bug fixes for (some of) the above problems.

Downloads
---------

See [PedOS Downloads](/downloads/).

Installation instructions
-------------------------

See [Installation Guide](/doc/installation-guide/).

Upgrading
---------

There is no in-place upgrade path from earlier PedOS versions. The only
supported option to upgrade to PedOS R4.0 is to install it from scratch and use
[PedOS backup and restore tools][backup] for migrating of all of the user VMs.
We also provide [detailed instruction][upgrade-to-r4.0] for this procedure.
