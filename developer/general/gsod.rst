Update and Expand How-To Guides – Qubes OS
------------------------------------------


About the Qubes OS Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Qubes OS is a security-focused operating system that allows you to
organize your digital life into compartments called “qubes.” If one qube
is compromised, the others remain safe, so a single cyberattack can no
longer take down your entire digital life in one fell swoop. You can
think of using Qubes OS as having many different computers on your desk
for different activities but with the convenience of a single physical
machine, a single unified desktop environment, and a set of tools for
using qubes together securely as parts of a unified system.

Qubes OS was launched in 2011 and has `received praise from security experts and organizations <https://www.qubes-os.org/endorsements/>`__ like Edward Snowden, the
Freedom of the Press Foundation, Micah Lee, and Let’s Encrypt. Qubes has
:doc:`over 40,000 active users </introduction/statistics>`. From network-level to
software-level protections, as well as protections against firmware and
hardware attacks, Qubes OS is trying to protect the user from the most
significant attacks they encounter so that they can get their work done
safely.

The project's problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


- Some of the existing content is stale. It refers to previous Qubes
  releases and has not yet been updated to the cover the latest stable
  release.

- There are important topic areas that the current guides do not
  completely cover, such as “understanding Qubes OS,” “using Qubes OS
  in practice,” “Qubes OS workflow for coding,” “printing,” and
  “audio.”

- The guides do not consistently address users of all skill and
  experience levels (beginner, intermediate, and expert).

- Some of the guides lack relevant illustrations and screenshots.

- When the developers update a software tool, they should update all
  the guides that mentions this tool. However, there is currently no
  way for the developers to know which guides mention which tools.



The project's scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The project is estimated to need around six months to complete (see the
timeline below). Qubes team members, including Michael Carbone, Andrew
Wong, Marta Marczykowska-Górecka, and Marek Marczykowski-Górecki, will
supervise and support the writer.

Measuring the project's success
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


We will consider the project successful if:

- Existing guides are updated to describe currently supported Qubes OS
  version

- Missing common guides are identified

- 2-3 new guides are written

Additional information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Qubes OS regularly participates in Google Summer of Code and Google
Season of Docs. This is our third time participating in Google Season of
Docs. Our mentorships for GSoD 2019, 2020, and 2023 were successes, and
the projects were completed within the times allotted. The past Google
Season of Docs projects have given us experience in working with
technical writers and have helped us to understand the benefits that
technical writers can bring to our project.

Here are some successful projects which have been implemented in the
past by Google Season of Docs participants.

Instructional video series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. _the-projects-problem-1:


The project's problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




There is user demand for high-quality, up-to-date video guides that take
users from zero Linux knowledge to using Qubes as a daily driver and
performing specific tasks inside of Qubes, but almost no such videos
exist. Although most of the required knowledge is documented, many users
report that they would prefer to watch videos rather than read text or
that they would find videos easier to understand and follow along with.

.. _the-projects-scope-1:


The project's scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




This project consists of creating a series of instructional videos that
satisfy the following criteria:

- Prospective users who are not yet familiar with Linux or Qubes OS can
  easily understand and follow the videos.

- The videos make a good effort to catch and keep the attention of
  their target audience.

- Users can follow the videos step-by-step to install Qubes OS and
  accomplish various tasks.

- The videos show the actual software being used (i.e., Qubes OS and
  any relevant software running inside of it).

- The videos are technically accurate, include security warnings where
  appropriate, and use terminology in a way that is consistent with the
  rest of the documentation (also see the
  :doc:`glossary </user/reference/glossary>`).

- The video series is comprehensive enough that users do not need to
  consult the documentation or ask questions (e.g., on the forum) in
  order to accomplish the most popular tasks and activities.

- The videos include voice narration. (Showing the speaker is
  optional.)

- The quality of the videos is consistent with current standards
  regarding things like editing, transitions, animations, lighting, and
  audio quality.

- The videos are in high definition (minimum 1080p, preferably 4k).

- The videos are separated into a series, where each video is an
  appropriate length and is appropriately connected to the other videos
  in the series.

- The videos are suitable for upload and sharing on popular
  video-sharing and social-media platforms, such as YouTube and
  Twitter. (The account or channel under which the videos are uploaded
  is open to discussion on platforms where the Qubes OS Project does
  not already have a significant established presence, such as
  YouTube.)

- The videos are suitable for embedding in appropriate places in the
  Qubes documentation. (E.g., a video on how to update Qubes OS should
  be appropriate for appearing on the :doc:`how to update </user/how-to-guides/how-to-update>` page.)

- Where possible, the videos should strive to be version-independent.
  (For example, a video explaining the template system should still be
  relevant many releases from now if the template system has not
  changed.)



Below is an example of the content (which is already
:doc:`documented </index>`) that the video series is likely to cover. The
precise scope of content is to be determined in consultation with the
video creator.

- Introduction to Qubes

- Selecting appropriate hardware

- How to install Qubes OS

- First steps after installing

- How to organize your qubes

- How to update

- How to back up, restore, and migrate

- How to copy and paste text (including dom0)

- How to copy and move files (including dom0)

- How to install software

- How to use and customize disposables

- How to enter fullscreen mode

- How to use devices (including block storage, USB, PCI, and optical)

- Templates: understanding, installing, uninstalling, reinstalling,
  etc.

- Common troubleshooting (preferably included in previous videos at
  appropriate points)

- The Qubes firewall

- Passwordless root

- Anti Evil Maid

- Split GPG

- CTAP proxy

- YubiKey

- Whonix

- How to install and use a VPN in Qubes

- How to install and use Windows in Qubes

- Other popular topics, as time permits



The project is estimated to need around six months to complete (see the
timeline below). Qubes team members, including Michael Carbone, Andrew
Wong, and Marek Marczykowski-Górecki, will supervise and support the
creator.

.. _measuring-the-projects-success-1:


Measuring the project's success
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




We will consider the project successful if, after publication of the
video series:

- Actual prospective users with no prior familiarity with Linux or
  Qubes OS are able to successfully install and use Qubes OS as
  intended by following along with the videos.

- The reception to the videos is generally positive and complaints
  about quality and accuracy are minimal.

- Appropriate analytics (e.g., YouTube metrics) are average or better
  for videos of this type (to be determined in consultation with the
  creator).



Consolidate troubleshooting guides
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**Project**: Consolidate troubleshooting guides

**Brief explanation**: Troubleshooting guides are scattered across many
pages and sometimes incomplete, leading to repeatedly posting the same
instruction over and over when helping users to diagnose problems. This
could be helped by writing a consolidated guide with a clear list of
symptom-action layout.

**Expected results**:

- Review existing :ref:`troubleshooting guides <index:troubleshooting>`

- Review
  `issues <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22C%3A+doc%22>`__
  containing common troubleshooting steps (checking specific logs etc)

- Propose updated, consolidated troubleshooting documentation,
  including its layout



**Knowledge prerequisite**:

- `Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__



**Mentor**: `Marek Marczykowski-Górecki <https://www.qubes-os.org/team/>`__

Improve Getting Started page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**Project**: Improve Getting Started page

**Brief explanation**: The :doc:`Getting Started page </introduction/getting-started>` is the place a new user would go to
understand better how to use Qubes. It is currently has old screenshots
not using the default desktop environment and could have much better
flow. In addition, this improved page content may end up being served
more directly to the user via the `offline documentation <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1019>`__
or the firstboot guide.

**Expected results**:

- Review the existing page and website, similar pages for other OSes

- Provide visual mock-ups and proposed text



**Knowledge prerequisite**:

- basic Qubes OS knowledge

- `Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__



**Mentor**: `Michael Carbone <https://www.qubes-os.org/team/>`__

Rewrite qrexec documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


**Project**: Rewrite qrexec documentation

**Brief explanation**: Current qrexec (qubes remote exec) documentation
is hard to follow, important information is hidden within a wall of
text. Some parts are split into multiple sections, for example version
specific to avoid duplication, but it doesn’t help reading it.
Additionally, protocol documentation describes only few specific use
cases, instead of being clear and precise protocol specification. Fixing
this last point may require very close cooperation with developers, as
the current documentation doesn’t multiple corner cases (that’s one of
the issue with its current shape).

**Expected results**:

- Review existing :doc:`qrexec documentation </developer/services/qrexec>` and an
  `issue about it <https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1392>`__

- Propose updated, consolidated admin documentation (policy writing,
  adding services)

- Propose consolidated protocol specification, based on the current
  documentation, and cooperation with developers



**Knowledge prerequisite**:

- `Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__



**Mentor**: `Marek Marczykowski-Górecki <https://www.qubes-os.org/team/>`__
