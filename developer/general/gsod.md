# 2020 Google Season of Docs

Thank you for your interest in participating in the [2020 Google Season of Docs][gsod] program with the [Qubes OS team][team]. You can read more about the Google Season of Docs in the official [guides][gsod-doc] and [FAQ][gsod-faq].

You can view the project we had in 2019 in the [2019 GSoD archive][2019-qubes-gsod] and the [2019 writer's report][2019-qubes-report].

## Project Ideas List

Everyone is encouraged to add ideas to this list, either by [editing this page directly][gsod.md] (preferred) or by replying to [this thread][gsod-2020-thread] (then we'll add it to this page for you). (See our [Documentation Guidelines] for general information about how to submit changes to the documentation, and see [Help, Support, and Mailing Lists] for information about our mailing lists.)

We currently have [over a hundred open documentation issues][doc-issues] in our issue tracker. Please feel free to use these for project ideas, as appropriate.

Here's a suggested template for adding project ideas:

```
### Adding a Proposal

**Project**: Something that you're totally excited about.

**Brief explanation**: What is the project?

**Expected results**: What is the expected result in the timeframe given?

**Knowledge prerequisite**: Pre-requisites for working on the project. What knowledge or resources are needed? If applicable, links to more information or discussions.

**Mentor**: Name and email address.
```
### Offline documentation

**Project**: Offline documentation

**Brief explanation**: Qubes OS has thorough documentation on the project website, however a user may find it more convenient to view documentation - especially for troubleshooting network issues -- offline on their Qubes machine. This will improve usability for new users and better support users if they need to troubleshoot anything.

**Expected results**: 

 - Review [past discussions on the issue](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1019)
 - Recommend workflow and platform for displaying offline documentation
 - Test workflow and platform to ensure usability and functionality

**Knowledge prerequisite**: 

 - [Markdown][markdown]

**Mentor**: [Marek Marczykowski-G贸recki][team]

### Create guide on firstboot for new users

**Project**: Create guide on firstboot for new users

**Brief explanation**: When a user first boots Qubes after installing it, there is an opportunity to introduce the user to some of the unique functionality Qubes has. This could be the same content as the [improved getting started page](https://www.qubes-os.org/getting-started/).

**Expected results**: 

 - Review [past discussions on the issue](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/1774)
 - Provide visual mock-ups and proposed text 
  
**Knowledge prerequisite**: 

 - some experience with Anaconda would be helpful

**Mentor**: [Marek Marczykowski-G贸recki][team]

### Improve Disposable VMs documentation

**Project**: Improve Disposable VMs documentation

**Brief explanation**: Current Disposable VMs documentation is scarce, inconsistent in places and in scattered across multiple pages, sometimes hard to find.
This project is about consolidating it into one or few easy to find pages, covering all related subjects.
And written in way easy to follow and understand, clearly separating basic use cases, advanced ones and internal details.
Additionally, terminology is used inconsistently.

**Expected results**:

- Review existing Disposable VM documentation
- Propose new documentation layout, including split between pages
- Propose updated and clarified content

**Knowledge prerequisite**:

- basic Qubes OS knowledge - [intro], [getting started]
- [Markdown][markdown]

**Mentor**: [Marek Marczykowski-G贸recki][team]

### Consolidate troubleshooting guides

**Project**: Consolidate troubleshooting guides

**Brief explanation**: Troubleshooting guides are scattered across many pages and sometimes incomplete, leading to repeatedly posting the same instruction over and over when helping users to diagnose problems.
This could be helped by writing consolidated guide with with a clear list of symptom-action layout.

**Expected results**:

- Review existing [troubleshooting guides](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/#troubleshooting)
- Review [issues][doc-issues] containing common troubleshooting steps (checking specific logs etc)
- Propose updated, consolidated troubleshooting documentation, including its layout

**Knowledge prerequisite**:

- [Markdown][markdown]
