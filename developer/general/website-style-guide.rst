===================
Website style guide
===================


This page explains the standards we follow for building and maintaining
the website. Please follow these guidelines and conventions when
modifying the website. For the standards governing the documentation in
particular, please see the :doc:`documentation style guide </developer/general/documentation-style-guide>`.

Coding conventions
------------------


The following conventions apply to the website as a whole, including
everything written in HTML, CSS, YAML, and Liquid. These conventions are
intended to keep the codebase consistent when multiple collaborators are
working on it. They should be understood as a practical set of rules for
maintaining order in this specific codebase rather than as a statement
of what is objectively right or good.

General practices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


- Use comments to indicate the purposes of different blocks of code.
  This makes the file easier to understand and navigate.

- Use descriptive variable names. Never use one or two letter variable
  names. Avoid obscure abbreviations and made-up words.

- In general, make it easy for others to read your code. Your future
  self will thank you, and so will your collaborators!

- `Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself>`__
  Instead of repeating the same block of code multiple times, abstract
  it out into a separate file and ``include`` that file where you need
  it.



Whitespace
^^^^^^^^^^


- Always use spaces. Never use tabs.

- Each indentation step should be exactly two (2) spaces.

- Whenever you add an opening tag, indent the following line.
  (Exception: If you open and close the tag on the same line, do not
  indent the following line.)

- Indent Liquid the same way as HTML.

- In general, the starting columns of every adjacent pair of lines
  should be no more than two spaces apart (example below).

- No blank or empty lines. (Hint: When you feel you need one, add a
  comment on that line instead.)



Indentation example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Here’s an example that follows the indentation rules:



.. code:: html

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th title="Anchor Link"><span class="fa fa-link"></span></th>
          {% for item in secs.htmlsections[0].columns %}
            <th>{{ item.title }}</th>
          {% endfor %}
        </tr>
        {% for canary in site.data.sec-canary reversed %}
          <tr id="{{ canary.canary }}">
            <td><a href="#{{ canary.canary }}" class="fa fa-link black-icon" title="Anchor link to Qubes Canary row: Qubes Canary #{{ canary.canary }}"></a></td>
            <td>{{ canary.date }}</td>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/canaries/canary-{{ canary.canary }}-{{ canary.date | date: '%Y' }}.txt">Qubes Canary #{{ canary.canary }}</a></td>
          </tr>
        {% endfor %}
      </table>
