Source code
===========


All the Qubes code is kept in Git repositories. We have divided the
project into several components, each of which has its own separate
repository, for example:

- ``core-admin.git`` – The core Qubes infrastructure, responsible for
  VM management, VM templates, fs sharing, etc.

- ``gui-daemon.git`` – GUI virtualization, Dom0 side.

- ``gui-agent-linux.git`` – GUI virtualization, Linux VM side.

- ``linux-template-builder.git`` – Scripts and other files used to
  create Qubes template images.



All of our repositories are available under the `QubesOS GitHub account <https://github.com/QubesOS/>`__.

To clone a repository:

.. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-<repo_name>.git <repo_name>



e.g.:

.. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin.git core-admin



To build Qubes you do not need to download all these repositories. If
you use :doc:`qubes builder </developer/building/qubes-builder>` you can specify *what*
you want to build, and download only the repositories needed to build
that target.

If you really do want to clone **all** of the repositories, you can use
these commands:

.. code:: bash

      curl "https://api.github.com/orgs/QubesOS/repos?page=1&per_page=100" | grep -e 'clone_url*' | cut -d \" -f 4 | xargs -L1 git clone
      curl "https://api.github.com/orgs/QubesOS/repos?page=2&per_page=100" | grep -e 'clone_url*' | cut -d \" -f 4 | xargs -L1 git clone



To update (git fetch) **all** of these repositories :

.. code:: bash

      find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec git -C {} fetch --tags --recurse-submodules=on-demand --all \;



(Alternatively, you can pull instead of just fetching.)

How to Send Patches
-------------------


If you want to :ref:`contribute code <introduction/contributing:contributing code>` to the project, there are
two ways. Whichever method you choose, you must :doc:`sign your code </developer/code/code-signing>` before it can be accepted.

- **Preferred**: Use GitHub’s `fork & pull requests <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`__.
  Opening a pull request on GitHub greatly eases the code review and
  tracking process. In addition, especially for bigger changes, it’s a
  good idea to send a message to the :ref:`qubes-devel mailing list <introduction/support:qubes-devel>` in order to notify people who do not
  receive GitHub notifications.

- Send a patch to the :ref:`qubes-devel mailing list <introduction/support:qubes-devel>` (``git format-patch``).

  1. Make all the changes in your working directory, i.e. edit files,
     move them around (you can use ‘git mv’ for this), etc.

  2. Add the changes and commit them (``git add``, ``git commit``).
     Never mix different changes into one commit! Write a good
     description of the commit. The first line should contain a short
     summary, and then, if you feel like more explanations are needed,
     enter an empty new line, and then start the long, detailed
     description (optional).

  3. Test your changes NOW: check if RPMs build fine, etc.

  4. Create the patch using ``git format-patch``. This has an advantage
     over ``git diff``, because the former will also include your
     commit message, your name and email, so that *your* name will be
     used as a commit’s author.

  5. Send your patch to ``qubes-devel``. Start the message subject with
     ``[PATCH]``.
